<big><big>COMMENTARY ON PLATES 5 &amp; 6.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL FORM OF THE DEEP CERVICAL AND FACIAL REGIONS, AND<br>
THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE PRINCIPAL BLOODVESSELS AND<br>
NERVES, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
While the human cervix is still extended in surgical position, its<br>
deeper anatomical relations, viewed as a whole, preserve the<br>
quadrilateral form. But as it is necessary to remove the<br>
sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, in order to expose the entire range of the<br>
greater bloodvessels and nerves, so the diagonal which that muscle<br>
forms, as seen in Plates 3 and 4, disappears, and thus both the cervical<br>
triangles are thrown into one common region. Although, however, the<br>
sterno-mastoid muscle be removed, as seen in Plate 5, still the great<br>
bloodvessels and nerves themselves will be observed to divide the<br>
cervical square diagonally, as they ascend the neck from the<br>
sterno-clavicular articulation to the ear.<br>
<br>
The diagonal of every square figure is the junction line of the opposite<br>
triangles which form the square. The cervical square being indicated as<br>
that space which lies within the mastoid process and the top of the<br>
sternum--the symphysis of the lower maxilla and the top of the shoulder,<br>
it will be seen, in Plate 5, that the line which the common carotid and<br>
internal jugular vein occupy in the neck, is the diagonal; and hence the<br>
junction line of the two surgical triangles.<br>
<br>
The general course of the common carotid artery and internal jugular<br>
vein is, therefore, obliquely backwards and upwards through the diagonal<br>
of the cervical square, and passing, as it were, from the point of one<br>
angle of the square to that of the opposite--viz., from the<br>
sterno-clavicular junction to the masto-maxillary space; and, taking the<br>
anterior triangle of the cervical square to be that space included<br>
within the points marked H 8 A, Plate 5, it will be seen that the common<br>
carotid artery ranges along the posterior side of this anterior<br>
triangle. Again: taking the points 5 Z Y to mark the posterior triangle<br>
of the cervical square, so will it be seen that the internal jugular<br>
vein and the common carotid artery, with the vagus nerve between them,<br>
range the anterior side of this posterior triangle, while the subclavian<br>
artery, Q, passes through the centre of the inferior side of the<br>
posterior triangle, that is, under the middle of the shaft of the<br>
clavicle.<br>
<br>
The main blood vessels (apparently according to original design) will be<br>
found always to occupy the centre of the animal fabric, and to seek<br>
deep-seated protection under cover of the osseous skeleton. The<br>
vertebrae of the neck, like those of the back and loins, support the<br>
principal vessels. Even in the limbs the large bloodvessels range<br>
alongside the protective shafts of the bones. The skeletal points are<br>
therefore the safest guides to the precise localities of the<br>
bloodvessels, and such points are always within the easy recognition of<br>
touch and sight.<br>
<br>
Close behind the right sterno-clavicular articulation, but separated<br>
from it by the sternal insertions of the thin ribbon-like muscles named<br>
sterno-hyoid and thyroid, together with the cervical fascia, is situated<br>
the brachio-cephalic or innominate artery, A B, Plates 5 and 6, having<br>
at its outer side the internal jugular division of the brachio-cephalic<br>
vein, W K, Plate 5. Between these vessels lies the vagus nerve, E, Plate<br>
6, N, Plate 5. The common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and<br>
vagus nerve, hold in respect to each other the same relationship in the<br>
neck, as far upwards as the angle of the jaw. While we view the general<br>
lateral outline of the neck, we find that, in the same measure as the<br>
blood vessels ascend from the thorax to the skull, they recede from the<br>
fore-part of the root of the neck to the angle of the jaw, whereby a<br>
much greater interval occurs between them and the mental symphysis, or<br>
the apex of the thyroid cartilage, than happens between them and the top<br>
of the sternum, as they lie at the root of the neck. This variation as<br>
to the width of the interval between the vessels and fore-part of the<br>
neck, in these two situations, is owing to two causes, 1st, the somewhat<br>
oblique course taken by the vessels from below upwards; 2dly, the<br>
projecting development of the adult lower jaw-bone, and also of the<br>
laryngeal apparatus, which latter organ, as it grows to larger<br>
proportions in the male than in the female, will cause the interval at<br>
this place to be much greater in the one than the other. In the infant,<br>
the larynx is of such small size, as scarcely to stand out beyond the<br>
level of the vessels, viewed laterally.<br>
<br>
The internal jugular vein is for almost its entire length covered by the<br>
sterno-mastoid muscle, and by that layer of the cervical aponeurosis<br>
which lies between the vessels and the muscle. The two vessels, K C,<br>
Plate 5, with the vagus nerve, are enclosed in a common sheath of<br>
cellular membrane, which sends processes between them so as to isolate<br>
the structures in some degree from one another.<br>
<br>
The trunk of the common carotid artery is in close proximity to the<br>
vagus nerve, this latter lying at the vessel's posterior side. The<br>
internal jugular vein, which sometimes lies upon and covering the<br>
carotid, will be found in general separated from it for a little space.<br>
Opposite the os hyoides, the internal jugular vein lies closer to the<br>
common carotid than it does farther down towards the root of the neck.<br>
Opposite to the sterno-clavicular articulation, the internal jugular<br>
vein will be seen separated from the common carotid for an interval of<br>
an inch and more in width, and at this interval appears the root of the<br>
subclavian artery, B, Plates 5 and 6, giving off its primary branches,<br>
viz., the thyroid axis, D, the vertebral and internal mammary arteries,<br>
at the first part of its course.<br>
<br>
The length of the common carotid artery varies, of course, according to<br>
the place where the innominate artery below divides, and also according<br>
to that place whereat the common carotid itself divides into internal<br>
and external carotids. In general, the length of the common carotid is<br>
considerable, and ranges between the sterno-clavicular articulation and<br>
the level of the os hyoides; throughout the whole of this length, it<br>
seldom or never happens that a large arterial branch is given off from<br>
the vessel, and the operation of ligaturing the common carotid is<br>
therefore much more likely to answer the results required of that<br>
proceeding than can be expected from the ligature of any part of the<br>
subclavian artery which gives off large arterial branches from every<br>
part of its course.<br>
<br>
The sympathetic nerve, R, Plate 6, is as close to the carotid artery<br>
behind, as the vagus nerve, N, Plate 5, and is as much endangered in<br>
ligaturing this vessel. The branch of the ninth nerve, E, Plate 5,<br>
(descendens noni,) lies upon the common carotid, itself or its sheath,<br>
and is likely to be included in the ligature oftener than we are aware<br>
of.<br>
<br>
The trunk of the external carotid, D, Plate 5, is in all cases very<br>
short, and in many bodies can scarcely be said to exist, in consequence<br>
of the thyroid, lingual, facial, temporal, and occipital branches,<br>
springing directly from almost the same point at which the common<br>
carotid gives off the internal carotid artery. The internal carotid is<br>
certainly the continuation of the common arterial trunk, while the<br>
vessel named external carotid is only a series of its branches. If the<br>
greater size of the internal carotid artery, compared to that of the<br>
external carotid, be not sufficient to prove that the former is the<br>
proper continuation of the common carotid, a fact may be drawn from<br>
comparative philosophy which will put the question beyond doubt,<br>
namely--that as the common carotid follows the line of the cervical<br>
vertebrae, just as the aorta follows that of the vertebrae of the trunk,<br>
so does the internal carotid follow the line of the cephalic vertebrae.<br>
I liken, therefore, those branches of the so-called external carotid to<br>
be, as it were, the visceral arteries of the face and neck. It would be<br>
quite possible to demonstrate this point of analogy, were this the place<br>
for analogical reasoning.<br>
<br>
The common carotid, or the internal, may be compressed against the<br>
rectus capitis anticus major muscle, 13, Plate 6, as it lies on the<br>
fore-part of the vertebral column. The internal maxillary artery, 16,<br>
Plate 6, and the facial artery, G, Plate 5, are those vessels which<br>
bleed when the lower maxilla is amputated. In this operation, the<br>
temporal artery, 15, Plate 6, will hardly escape being divided also, it<br>
lies in such close proximity to the neck and condyle of the jaw-bone.<br>
<br>
The subclavian artery, B Q, Plate 5, traverses the root of the neck, in<br>
an arched direction from the sterno-clavicular articulation to the<br>
middle of the shaft of the clavicle, beneath which it passes, being<br>
destined for the arm. In general, this vessel rises to a level<br>
considerably above the clavicle; and all that portion of the arching<br>
course which it makes at this situation over the first rib has become<br>
the subject of operation. The middle of this arching subclavian artery<br>
is (by as much as the thickness of the scalenus muscle, X, Plate 5)<br>
deeper situated than either extremity of the arch of this vessel, and<br>
deeper also than any part of the common carotid, by the same fact. So<br>
many branches spring from all parts of the arch of the subclavian<br>
artery, that the operation of ligaturing this vessel is less successful<br>
than the same operation exercised on others.<br>
<br>
The structures which lie in connexion with the arch of the subclavian<br>
also render the operation of tying the vessel an anxious task. It is<br>
crossed and recrossed at all points by large veins, important nerves,<br>
and by its own principal branches. The vagus nerve, S E, Plate 6,<br>
crosses it at B, its root; external to which place the large internal<br>
jugular vein, K, Plate 5, lies upon it; external to this latter, the<br>
scalenus muscle, X, Plate 5, with the phrenic nerve lying upon the<br>
muscle, binds it fixedly to the first rib; more external still, the<br>
common trunk of the external jugular and shoulder veins, U, Plate 5, lie<br>
upon the vessel, and it is in the immediate vicinity of the great<br>
brachial plexus of nerves, P P, which pass down along its humeral<br>
border, many branches of the same plexus sometimes crossing it<br>
anteriorly.<br>
<br>
The depth at which the middle of the subclavian artery lies may be<br>
learned by the space which those structures, beneath which it passes,<br>
necessarily occupy. The clavicle at its sternal end is round and thick,<br>
where it gives attachment to the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle. The root<br>
of the internal jugular vein, when injected, will be seen to occupy<br>
considerable space behind the clavicle; and the anterior scalenus muscle<br>
is substantial and fleshy. The united spaces occupied by these<br>
structures give the depth of the subclavian artery in the middle part of<br>
its course.<br>
<br>
The length of the subclavian artery between its point of branching from<br>
the innominate and that where it gives off its first branches varies in<br>
different bodies, but is seldom so extensive as to assure the operator<br>
of the ultimate success of the process of ligaturing the vessel. Above<br>
and below D, Plate 6, the thyroid axis, come off the vertebral and<br>
internal mammary arteries internal and anterior to the scalenus muscle.<br>
External and posterior to the scalenus, a large vessel, the post<br>
scapular, G, Plate 6, R, Plate 5, arises. If an aneurism attack any part<br>
of this subclavian arch, it must be in close connexion with some one of<br>
these branches. If a ligature is to be applied to any part of the arch,<br>
it will seldom happen that it can be placed farther than half an inch<br>
from some of these principal collateral branches.<br>
<br>
When the shoulder is depressed, the clavicle follows it, and the<br>
subclavian artery will be more exposed and more easily reached than if<br>
the shoulder be elevated, as this latter movement raises the clavicle<br>
over the locality of the vessel. Dupuytren alludes practically to the<br>
different depths of the subclavian artery in subjects with short necks<br>
and high shoulders, and those with long necks and pendent shoulders.<br>
When the clavicle is depressed to the fullest extent, if then the<br>
sterno-cleido-mastoid and scalenus muscles be relaxed by inclining the<br>
head and neck towards the artery, I believe it may be possible to arrest<br>
the flow of blood through the artery by compressing it against the first<br>
rib, and this position will also facilitate the operation of ligaturing<br>
the vessel.<br>
<br>
The subclavian vein, W, Plate 5, is removed to some distance from the<br>
artery, Q, Plate 5. The width of the scalenus muscle, X, separates the<br>
vein from the artery. An instance is recorded by Blandin in which the<br>
vein passed in company with the artery under the scalenus muscle.<br>
