PREFACE.<br>
<br>
The object of this work is to present to the student of medicine and the<br>
practitioner removed from the schools, a series of dissections<br>
demonstrative of the relative anatomy of the principal regions of the<br>
human body. Whatever title may most fittingly apply to a work with this<br>
intent, whether it had better be styled surgical or medical, regional,<br>
relative, descriptive, or topographical anatomy, will matter little,<br>
provided its more salient or prominent character be manifested in its<br>
own form and feature. The work, as I have designed it, will itself show<br>
that my intent has been to base the practical upon the anatomical, and<br>
to unite these wherever a mutual dependence was apparent.<br>
<br>
That department of anatomical research to which the name topographical<br>
strictly applies, as confining itself to the mere account of the form<br>
and relative location of the several organs comprising the animal body,<br>
is almost wholly isolated from the main questions of physiological and<br>
transcendental interest, and cannot, therefore, be supposed to speak in<br>
those comprehensive views which anatomy, taken in its widest<br>
signification as a science, necessarily includes. While the anatomist<br>
contents himself with describing the form and position of organs as they<br>
appear exposed, layer after layer, by his dissecting instruments, he<br>
does not pretend to soar any higher in the region of science than the<br>
humble level of other mechanical arts, which merely appreciate the<br>
fitting arrangement of things relative to one another, and combinative<br>
to the whole design of the form or machine of whatever species this may<br>
be, whether organic or inorganic. The descriptive anatomist of the human<br>
body aims at no higher walk in science than this, and hence his<br>
nomenclature is, as it is, a barbarous jargon of words, barren of all<br>
truthful signification, inconsonant with nature, and blindly<br>
irrespective of the <span style="font-style: italic;">cognitio certa
ex principiis certis exorta.</span><br>
<br>
Still, however, this anatomy of form, although so much requiring<br>
purification of its nomenclature, in order to clothe it in the high<br>
reaching dignity of a science, does not disturb the medical or surgical<br>
practitioner, so far as <span style="font-style: italic;">their </span>wants
are concerned. Although it may, and<br>
actually does, trammel the votary who aspires to the higher<br>
generalizations and the development of a law of formation, yet, as this<br>
is not the object of the surgical anatomist, the nomenclature, such as<br>
it is, will answer conveniently enough the present purpose.<br>
<br>
The anatomy of the human form, contemplated in reference to that of all<br>
other species of animals to which it bears comparison, constitutes the<br>
study of the comparative anatomist, and, as such, establishes the<br>
science in its full intent. But the anatomy of the human figure,<br>
considered as a species, <span style="font-style: italic;">per se,</span>
is confessedly the humblest walk of the<br>
understanding in a subject which, as anatomy, is relationary, and<br>
branches far and wide through all the domain of an animal kingdom. While<br>
restricted to the study of the isolated human species, the cramped<br>
judgment wastes in such narrow confine; whereas, in the expansive gaze<br>
over all allying and allied species, the intellect bodies forth to its<br>
vision the full appointed form of natural majesty; and after having<br>
experienced the manifold analogies and differentials of the many, is<br>
thereby enabled, when it returns to the study of the one, to view this<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> of human type under
manifold points of interest, to the appreciation<br>
of which the understanding never wakens otherwise. If it did not happen<br>
that the study of the human form (confined to itself) had some practical<br>
bearing, such study could not deserve the name of anatomical, while<br>
anatomical means comparative, and whilst comparison implies inductive<br>
reasoning.<br>
<br>
However, practical anatomy, such as it is, is concerned with an exact<br>
knowledge of the relationship of organs as they stand in reference to<br>
each other, and to the whole design of which these organs are the<br>
integral parts. The figure, the capacity, and the contents of the<br>
thoracic and abdominal cavities, become a study of not more urgent<br>
concernment to the physician, than are the regions named cervical,<br>
axillary, inguinal, &amp;c., to the surgeon. He who would combine both
modes<br>
of a relationary practice, such as that of medicine and surgery, should<br>
be well acquainted with the form and structures characteristic of all<br>
regions of the human body; and it may be doubted whether he who pursues<br>
either mode of practice, wholly exclusive of the other, can do so with<br>
honest purpose and large range of understanding, if he be not equally<br>
well acquainted with the subject matter of both. It is, in fact, more<br>
triflingly fashionable than soundly reasonable, to seek to define the<br>
line of demarcation between the special callings of medicine and<br>
surgery, for it will ever be as vain an endeavour to separate the one<br>
from the other without extinguishing the vitality of both, as it would<br>
be to sunder the trunk from the head, and give to each a separate living<br>
existence. The necessary division of labour is the only reason that can<br>
be advanced in excuse of specialisms; but it will be readily agreed to,<br>
that that practitioner who has first laid within himself the foundation<br>
of a general knowledge of matters relationary to his subject, will<br>
always be found to pursue the speciality according to the light of<br>
reason and science.<br>
<br>
Anatomy--the&nbsp;<img style="width: 183px; height: 50px;" alt=""
 src="images/0Title6Pic.jpg"> the knowledge
based on principle--is the<br>
foundation of the curative art, cultivated as a science in all its<br>
branchings; and comparison is the nurse of reason, which we are fain to<br>
make our guide in bringing the practical to bear productively. The human<br>
body, in a state of health, is the standard whereunto we compare the<br>
same body in a state of disease. The knowledge of the latter can only<br>
exist by the knowledge of the former, and by the comparison of both.<br>
<br>
Comparison may be fairly termed the pioneer to all certain knowledge. It<br>
is a potent instrument--the only one, in the hands of the pathologist,<br>
as well as in those of the philosophic generalizer of anatomical facts,<br>
gathered through the extended survey of an animal kingdom. We best<br>
recognise the condition of a dislocated joint after we have become well<br>
acquainted with the contour of its normal state; all abnormal conditions<br>
are best understood by a knowledge of what we know to be normal<br>
character. Every anatomist is a comparer, in a greater or lesser degree;<br>
and he is the greatest anatomist who compares the most generally.<br>
<br>
Impressed with this belief, I have laid particular emphasis on imitating<br>
the character of the normal form of the human figure, taken as a whole;<br>
that of its several regions as parts of this whole, and that of the<br>
various organs (contained within those regions) as its integrals or<br>
elements. And in order to present this subject of relative anatomy in<br>
more vivid reality to the understanding of the student, I have chosen<br>
the medium of illustrating by figure rather than by that of written<br>
language, which latter, taken alone, is almost impotent in a study of<br>
this nature.<br>
<br>
It is wholly impossible for anyone to describe form in words without the<br>
aid of figures. Even the mathematical strength of Euclid would avail<br>
nothing, if shorn of his diagrams. The professorial robe is impotent<br>
without its diagrams. Anatomy being a science existing by demonstration,<br>
(for as much as form in its actuality is the language of nature,) must<br>
be discoursed of by the instrumentality of figure.<br>
<br>
An anatomical illustration enters the understanding straight-forward in<br>
a direct passage, and is almost independent of the aid of written<br>
language. A picture of form is a proposition which solves itself. It is<br>
an axiom encompassed in a frame-work of self-evident truth. The best<br>
substitute for Nature herself, upon which to teach the knowledge of her,<br>
is an exact representation of her form.<br>
<br>
Every surgical anatomist will (if he examine himself) perceive that,<br>
previously to undertaking the performance of an operation upon the<br>
living body, he stands reassured and self-reliant in that degree in<br>
which he is capable of conjuring up before his mental vision a distinct<br>
picture of his subject. Mr. Liston could draw the same anatomical<br>
picture mentally which Sir Charles Bell's handicraft could draw in<br>
reality of form and figure. Scarpa was his own draughtsman.<br>
<br>
If there may be any novelty now-a-days possible to be recognised upon<br>
the out-trodden track of human relative anatomy, it can only be in<br>
truthful and well-planned illustration. Under this view alone may the<br>
anatomist plead an excuse for reiterating a theme which the beautiful<br>
works of Cowper, Haller, Hunter, Scarpa, Soemmering, and others, have<br>
dealt out so respectably. Except the human anatomist turns now to what<br>
he terms the practical ends of his study, and marshals his little<br>
knowledge to bear upon those ends, one may proclaim anthropotomy to have<br>
worn itself out. Dissection can do no more, except to repeat<br>
Cruveilhier. And that which Cruveilhier has done for human anatomy,<br>
Muller has completed for the physiological interpretation of human<br>
anatomy; Burdach has philosophised, and Magendie has experimented to the<br>
full upon this theme, so far as it would permit. All have pushed the<br>
subject to its furthest limits, in one aspect of view. The narrow circle<br>
is footworn. All the needful facts are long since gathered, sown, and<br>
known. We have been seekers after those facts from the days of<br>
Aristotle. Are we to put off the day of attempting interpretation for<br>
three thousand years more, to allow the human physiologist time to slice<br>
the brain into more delicate atoms than he has done hitherto, in order<br>
to coin more names, and swell the dictionary? No! The work must now be<br>
retrospective, if we would render true knowledge progressive. It is not<br>
a list of new and disjointed facts that Science at present thirsts for;<br>
but she is impressed with the conviction that her wants can alone be<br>
supplied by the creation of a new and truthful theory,--a generalization<br>
which the facts already known are sufficient to supply, if they were<br>
well ordered according to their natural relationship and mutual<br>
dependence. "Le temps viendra peut-etre," says Fontenelle, "que 1'on<br>
joindra en un corps regulier ces membres epars; et, s'ils sont tels<br>
qu'on le souhaite, ils s'assembleront en quelque sorte d'eux-memes.<br>
Plusieurs verites separees, des qu'elles sont en assez grand nombre,<br>
offrent si vivement a 1'esprit leurs rapports et leur mutuelle<br>
dependance, qu'il semble qu'apres les avoir detachees par une espece de<br>
violence les unes des autres, elles cherchent naturellement a se<br>
reunir."--(Preface sur l'utilite des Sciences, &amp;c.)<br>
<br>
The comparison of facts already known must henceforward be the scalpel<br>
which we are to take in hand. We must return by the same road on which<br>
we set out, and reexamine the things and phenomena which, as novices, we<br>
passed by too lightly. The travelled experience may now sit down and<br>
contemplate.<br>
<br>
That which I have said and proved elsewhere in respect to the skeleton<br>
system may, with equal truth, be remarked of the nervous system--namely,<br>
that the question is not in how far does the limit of diversity extend<br>
through the condition of an evidently common analogy, but by what rule<br>
or law the uniform ens is rendered the diverse entity? The womb of<br>
anatomical science is pregnant of the true interpretation of the law of<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">unity in variety</span>; but the
question is of longer duration than was the<br>
life of the progenitor. Though Aristotle and Linnaeus, and Buffon and<br>
Cuvier, and Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Leibnitz, and Gothe, have lived and<br>
spoken, yet the present state of knowledge proclaims the Newton of<br>
physiology to be as yet unborn. The iron scalpel has already made<br>
acquaintance with not only the greater parts, but even with the<br>
infinitesimals of the human body; and reason, confined to this narrow<br>
range of a subject, perceives herself to be imprisoned, and quenches her<br>
guiding light in despair. Originality has outlived itself; and discovery<br>
is a long-forgotten enterprise, except as pursued in the microcosm on<br>
the field of the microscope, which, it must be confessed, has drawn<br>
forth demonstrations only commensurate in importance with the magnitude<br>
of the littleness there seen.<br>
<br>
The subject of our study, whichever it happen to be, may appear<br>
exhausted of all interest, and the promise of valuable novelty, owing to<br>
two reasons:--It may be, like descriptive human anatomy, so cold, poor<br>
and sterile in its own nature, and so barren of product, that it will be<br>
impossible for even the genius of Promethean fire to warm it; or else,<br>
like existing physiology, the very point of view from which the mental<br>
eye surveys the theme, will blight the fair prospect of truth, distort<br>
induction, and clog up the paces of ratiocination. The physiologist of<br>
the present day is too little of a comparative anatomist, and far too<br>
closely enveloped in the absurd jargon of the anthropotomist, ever to<br>
hope to reveal any great truth for science, and dispel the mists which<br>
still hang over the phenomena of the nervous system. He is steeped too<br>
deeply in the base nomenclature of the antique school, and too indolent<br>
to question the import of Pons, Commissure, Island, Taenia, Nates,<br>
Testes, Cornu, Hippocamp, Thalamus, Vermes, Arbor Vitro, Respiratory<br>
Tract, Ganglia of Increase, and all such phrase of unmeaning sound, ever<br>
to be productive of lucid interpretation of the cerebro-spinal ens.<br>
Custom alone sanctions his use of such names; but<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Custom calls him to it!<br>
&nbsp; What custom wills; should custom always do it,<br>
&nbsp; The dust on antique time would lie unswept,<br>
&nbsp; And mountainous error be too highly heaped,<br>
&nbsp; For truth to overpeer."<br>
<br>
Of the illustrations of this work I may state, in guarantee of their<br>
anatomical accuracy, that they have been made by myself from my own<br>
dissections, first planned at the London University College, and<br>
afterwards realised at the Ecole Pratique, and School of Anatomy<br>
adjoining the Hospital La Pitie, Paris, a few years since. As far as the<br>
subject of relative anatomy could admit of novel treatment, rigidly<br>
confined to facts unalterable, I have endeavoured to give it.<br>
<br>
The unbroken surface of the human figure is as a map to the surgeon,<br>
explanatory of the anatomy arranged beneath; and I have therefore left<br>
appended to the dissected regions as much of the undissected as was<br>
necessary. My object was to indicate the interior through the<br>
superficies, and thereby illustrate the whole living body which concerns<br>
surgery, through its dissected dead counterfeit. We dissect the dead<br>
animal body in order to furnish the memory with as clear an account of<br>
the structure contained in its living representative, which we are not<br>
allowed to analyse, as if this latter were perfectly translucent, and<br>
directly demonstrative of its component parts.<br>
