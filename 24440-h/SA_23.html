COMMENTARY ON PLATE 23.<br>
<br>
THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE DEEPER ORGANS<br>
OF THE THORAX AND THOSE OF THE ABDOMEN.<br>
<br>
The size or capacity of the thorax in relation to that of the abdomen<br>
varies in the individual at different periods of life. At an early age,<br>
the thorax, compared to the abdomen, is less in proportion than it is at<br>
adult age. The digestive organs in early age preponderate considerably<br>
over the respiratory organs; whereas, on the contrary, in the healthy<br>
and well-formed adult, the thoracic cavity and organs of respiration<br>
manifest a greater relative proportion to the ventral cavity and organs.<br>
At the adult age, when sexual peculiarities have become fully marked,<br>
the thoracic organs of the male body predominate over those of the<br>
abdomen, whilst in the female form the ventral organs take precedence as<br>
to development and proportions. This diversity in the relative capacity<br>
of the thorax and abdomen at different stages of development, and also<br>
in persons of different sexes, stamps each individual with<br>
characteristic traits of physical conformation; and it is required that<br>
we should take into our consideration this normal diversity of<br>
character, while conducting our examinations of individuals in reference<br>
to the existence of disease.<br>
<br>
The heart varies in some measure, not only as to size and weight, but<br>
also as to position, even in healthy individuals of the same age and<br>
sex. The level at which the heart is in general found to be situated in<br>
the thorax is that represented in PLATE 23, where the apex points to the<br>
sixth intercostal space on the left side above K, while the arch of the<br>
aorta rises to a level with C, the second costal cartilage. In some<br>
instances, the heart may be found to occupy a much lower position in the<br>
thorax than the one above mentioned, or even a much higher level. The<br>
impulse of the right ventricle, F, has been noticed occasionally as<br>
corresponding to a point somewhat above the middle of the sternum and<br>
the intercostal space between the fourth and fifth left costal<br>
cartilages; while in other instances its beating was observable as low<br>
down as an inch or more below the xiphoid cartilage, and these<br>
variations have existed in a state of health.<br>
<br>
Percussion over the region of the heart yields a dull flat sound. The<br>
sound is dullest opposite the right ventricle, F; whilst above and to<br>
either side of this point, where the heart is overlapped by the anterior<br>
shelving edges of both lungs, the sound is modified in consequence of<br>
the lung's resonant qualities. The heart-sounds, as heard through the<br>
stethoscope, in valvular disease, will, of course, be more distinctly<br>
ascertained at the locality of F, the right ventricle, which is<br>
immediately substernal. While the body lies supine, the heart recedes<br>
from the forepart of the chest; and the lungs during inspiration<br>
expanding around the heart will render its sounds less distinct. In the<br>
erect posture, the heart inclines forwards and approaches the anterior<br>
wall of the thorax. When the heart is hypertrophied, the lungs do not<br>
overlap it to the same extent as when it is of its ordinary size. In the<br>
latter state, the elastic cushion of the lung muffles the heart's<br>
impulse. In the former state, the lung is pushed aside by the overgrown<br>
heart, the strong muscular walls of which strike forcibly against the<br>
ribs and sternum.<br>
<br>
The thorax is separated from the abdomen by the moveable diaphragm. The<br>
heart, F E, lies upon the diaphragm, L L*. The liver, M, lies<br>
immediately beneath the right side of this muscular septum, L*, while<br>
the bulging cardiac end of the stomach, O, is in close contact with it<br>
on the left side, L. As these three organs are attached to the<br>
diaphragm--the heart by its pericardium, the stomach by the tube of the<br>
oesophagus, and the liver by its suspensory ligaments--it must happen<br>
that the diaphragm while descending and ascending in the motions of<br>
inspiration and expiration will communicate the same alternate motions<br>
to the organs which are connected with it.<br>
<br>
In ordinary respiration the capacity of the thorax is chiefly affected<br>
by the motions of the diaphragm; and the relative position which this<br>
septum holds with regard to the thoracic and abdominal chambers will<br>
cause its motions of ascent and descent to influence the capacity of<br>
both chambers at the same time. When the lungs expand, they follow the<br>
descent of the diaphragm, which forces the abdominal contents downwards,<br>
and thus what the thorax gains in space the abdomen loses. When the<br>
lungs contract, the diaphragm ascends, and by this act the abdomen gains<br>
that space which the thorax loses. But the organs of the thoracic cavity<br>
perform a different office in the economy from those of the abdomen. The<br>
air which fills the lungs is soon again expired, whilst the ingesta of<br>
the abdominal viscera are for a longer period retained; and as the<br>
space, which by every inspiration the thorax gains from the abdomen,<br>
would cause inconvenient pressure on the distended organs of this latter<br>
cavity, so we find that to obviate this inconvenience, nature has<br>
constructed the anterior parietes of the abdomen of yielding material.<br>
The muscular parietes of the abdomen relax during every inspiration, and<br>
thus this cavity gains that space which it loses by the encroachment of<br>
the dilating lungs.<br>
<br>
The mechanical principle upon which the abdominal chamber is<br>
constructed, enables it to adjust its capacity to such exigence or<br>
pressing necessity as its own visceral organs impose on it, from time to<br>
time; and the relation which the abdominal cavity bears to the thoracic<br>
chamber, enables it also to be compensatory to this latter. When the<br>
inspiratory thorax gains space from the abdomen, or when space is<br>
demanded for the increasing bulk of the alimentary canal, or for the<br>
enlarging pregnant uterus; or when, in consequence of disease, such as<br>
dropsical accumulation, more room is wanted, then the abdominal chamber<br>
supplies the demand by the anterior bulge or swell of its expansile<br>
muscular parietes.<br>
<br>
The position of the heart itself is affected by the expansion of the<br>
lungs on either side of it. As the expanding lungs force the diaphragm<br>
downwards, the heart follows it, and all the abdominal viscera yield<br>
place to the descending thoracic contents. In strong muscular efforts<br>
the diaphragm plays an important part, for, previously to making forced<br>
efforts, the lungs are distended with air, so as to swell and render<br>
fixed the thoracic walls into which so many powerful muscles of the<br>
shoulders, the neck, back, and abdomen, are inserted; at the same time<br>
the muscular diaphragm L L*, becomes tense and unbent from its arched<br>
form, thereby contracting abdominal space, which now has no compensation<br>
for this loss of space, since the abdominal parietes are also rendered<br>
firm and unyielding. It is at this crisis of muscular effort that the<br>
abdominal viscera become impacted together; and, acting by their own<br>
elasticity against the muscular force, make an exit for themselves<br>
through the weakest parts of the abdominal walls, and thus herniae of<br>
various kinds are produced. The most common situations of abdominal<br>
herniae are at the inguinal regions, towards which the intestines, T T,<br>
naturally gravitate; and at these situations the abdominal parietes are<br>
weak and membranous.<br>
<br>
The contents of a hernial protrusion through the abdominal parietes,<br>
correspond in general with those divisions of the intestinal tube, which<br>
naturally lie adjacent to the part where the rupture has taken place. In<br>
the umbilical hernia it is either the transverse colon S*, or some part<br>
of the small intestine occupying the median line, or both together, with<br>
some folds of the omentum, which will be found to form the contents of<br>
this swelling. When the diaphragm itself sustains a rupture in its left<br>
half, the upper portion of the descending colon, S, protrudes through<br>
the opening. A diaphragmatic hernia has not, so far as I am aware, been<br>
seen to occur in the right side; and this exemption from rupture of the<br>
right half of the diaphragm may be accounted for anatomically, by the<br>
fact that the liver, M, defends the diaphragm at this situation. The<br>
liver occupies the whole depth of the right hypochondrium; and<br>
intervenes between the diaphragm L*, and the right extremity of the<br>
transverse colon, S**.<br>
<br>
The contents of a right inguinal hernia consist of the small intestine,<br>
T. The contents of the right crural hernia are formed by either the<br>
small intestine, T, or the intestinum caecum, S***. I have seen a few<br>
cases in which the caecum formed the right crural hernia. Examples are<br>
recorded in which the intestine caecum formed the contents of a right<br>
inguinal hernia. The left inguinal and crural herniae contain most<br>
generally the small intestine, T, of the left side.<br>
<br>
The right lung, I*, is shorter than the left; for the liver, M, raises<br>
the diaphragm, L, to a higher level within the thorax, on the right<br>
side, than it does on the left. When the liver happens to be diseased<br>
and enlarged, it encroaches still more on thoracic space; but,<br>
doubtless, judging from the anatomical connexions of the liver, we may<br>
conclude that when it becomes increased in volume it will accommodate<br>
itself as much at the expense of abdominal space. The liver, in its<br>
healthy state and normal proportions, protrudes for an inch (more or<br>
less) below the margins of the right asternal ribs. The upper or convex<br>
surface of the liver rises beneath the diaphragm to a level<br>
corresponding with the seventh or sixth rib, but this position will vary<br>
according to the descent and ascent of the diaphragm in the respiratory<br>
movements. The ligaments by which the liver is suspended do not prevent<br>
its full obedience to these motions.<br>
<br>
The left lung, I, descends to a lower level than the right; and the left<br>
diaphragm upon which it rests is itself supported by the cardiac end of<br>
the stomach. When the stomach is distended, it does not even then<br>
materially obstruct the expansion of the left lung, or the descent of<br>
the left diaphragm, for the abdominal walls relax and allow of the<br>
increasing volume of the stomach to accommodate itself. The spleen, R,<br>
is occasionally subject to an extraordinary increase of bulk; and this<br>
organ, like the enlarged liver and the distended stomach, will, to some<br>
extent, obstruct the movements of the diaphragm in the act of<br>
respiration, but owing to its free attachments it admits of a change of<br>
place. The abdominal viscera, one and all, admit of a change of place;<br>
the peculiar forms of those mesenteric bonds by which they are<br>
suspended, allow them to glide freely over each other; and this<br>
circumstance, together with the yielding nature of the abdominal<br>
parietes, allows the thoracic organs to have full and easy play in the<br>
respiratory movements performed by agency of the diaphragm.<br>
<br>
The muscles of respiration perform with ease so long as the air has<br>
access to the lungs through the normal passage, viz., the trachea. While<br>
the principle of the thoracic pneumatic apparatus remains underanged,<br>
the motor powers perform their functions capably. The physical or<br>
pneumatic power acts in obedience to the vital or muscular power, while<br>
both stand in equilibrium; but the ascendancy of the one over the other<br>
deranges the whole thoracic machine. When the glottis closes by muscular<br>
spasm and excludes the external air, the respiratory muscles cease to<br>
exert a motor power upon the pulmonary cavity; their united efforts<br>
cannot cause a vacuum in thoracic space in opposition to the pressure of<br>
the external air. When, in addition to the natural opening of the<br>
glottis, a false opening is made in the side at the point K, the air<br>
within the lung at I, and external to it in the now open pleural cavity,<br>
will stand in equilibrio; the lung will collapse as having no muscular<br>
power by which to dilate itself, and the thoracic dilator muscles will<br>
cease to affect the capacity of the lung, so long as by their action in<br>
expanding the thoracic walls, the air gains access through the side to<br>
the pleural sac external to the lung.<br>
<br>
Whether the air be admitted into the pleural sac, by an opening made in<br>
the side from without, or by an opening in the lung itself, the<br>
mechanical principle of the respiratory apparatus will be equally<br>
deranged. Pneumo-thorax will be the result of either lesion; and by the<br>
accumulation of air in the pleura the lung will suffer pressure. This<br>
pressure will be permanent so long as the air has no egress from the<br>
cavity of the pleura.<br>
<br>
The permanent distention of the thoracic cavity, caused by the<br>
accumulation of air in the pleural sac, or by the diffusion of air<br>
through the interlobular cellular tissue consequent on a wound of the<br>
lung itself, will equally obstruct the breathing; and though the<br>
situation of the accumulated air is in fact anatomically different in<br>
both cases, yet the effect produced is similar. Interlobular pressure<br>
and interpleural pressure result in the same thing, viz., the permanent<br>
retention of the air external to the pulmonary cells, which, in the<br>
former case, are collapsed individually; and, in the latter case, in the<br>
mass. Though the emphysematous lung is distended to a size equal to the<br>
healthy lung in deep inspiration, yet we know that emphysematous<br>
distention, being produced by extrabronchial air accumulation, is, in<br>
fact, obstructive to the respiratory act. The emphysematous lung will,<br>
in the same manner as the distended pleural sac, depress the diaphragm<br>
and render the thoracic muscles inoperative. The foregoing observations<br>
have been made in reference to the effect of wounds of the thorax, the<br>
proper treatment of which will be obviously suggested by our knowledge<br>
of the state of the contained organs which have suffered lesion.<br>
