<br>
THE DISSECTION OF FEMORAL HERNIA, AND THE SEAT OF STRICTURE.<br>
<br>
Whilst all forms of inguinal herniae escape from the abdomen at places<br>
situated immediately above Poupart's ligament, the femoral hernia, G,<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 43, is found to pass from the abdomen immediately below<br>
this structure, A I, and between it and the horizontal branch of the<br>
pubic bone. The inguinal canal and external abdominal ring are parts<br>
concerned in the passage of inguinal herniae, whether oblique or direct,<br>
external or internal; whilst the femoral canal and saphenous opening are<br>
the parts through which the femoral hernia passes. Both these orders of<br>
parts, and of the herniae connected with them respectively, are,<br>
however, in reality situated so closely to each other in the<br>
inguino-femoral region, that, in order to understand either, we should,<br>
examine both at the same time comparatively.<br>
<br>
The structure which is named Poupart's ligament in connexion with<br>
inguinal herniae, is named the femoral or crural arch (Gimbernat) in<br>
relation to femoral hernia. The simple line, therefore, described by<br>
this ligament explains the narrow interval which separates both<br>
varieties of the complaint. So small is the line of separation described<br>
between these herniae by the ligament, that this (so to express the<br>
idea) stands in the character of an arch, which, at the same time,<br>
supports an aqueduct (the inguinal canal) and spans a road (the femoral<br>
sheath.) The femoral arch, A I, Fig. 1, Plate 43, extends between the<br>
anterior superior iliac spinous process and the pubic spine. It connects<br>
the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, D <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, Fig. 2, Plate 44,<br>
with F, the fascia lata. Immediately above and below its pubic extremity<br>
appear the external ring and the saphenous opening. On cutting through<br>
the falciform process, F, Fig. 1, Plate 44, we find Gimbernat's<br>
ligament, R, a structure well known in connexion with femoral hernia.<br>
Gimbernat's ligament consists of tendinous fibres which connect the<br>
inner end of the femoral arch with the pectineal ridge of the os pubis.<br>
The shape of the ligament is acutely triangular, corresponding to the<br>
form of the space which it occupies. Its apex is internal, and close to<br>
the pubic spine; its base is external, sharp and concave, and in<br>
apposition with the sheath of the femoral vessels. It measures an inch,<br>
more or less, in width, and it is broader in the male than in the<br>
female--a fact which is said to account for the greater frequency of<br>
femoral hernia in the latter sex than in the former, (Monro.) Its<br>
strength and density also vary in different individuals. It is covered<br>
anteriorly by, P, Fig. 1, Plate 44, the upper cornu of the falciform<br>
process; and behind, it is in connexion with, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">k</span>, the conjoined tendon.<br>
This tendon is inserted with the ligament into the pectineal ridge. The<br>
falciform process also blends with the ligament; and thus it is that the<br>
femoral hernia, when constricted by either of these three structures,<br>
may well be supposed to suffer pressure from the three together.<br>
<br>
A second or deep femoral arch is occasionally met with. This structure<br>
consists of tendinous fibres, lying deeper than, but parallel with,<br>
those of the superficial arch. The deep arch spans the femoral sheath<br>
more closely than the superficial arch, and occupies the interval left<br>
between the latter and the sheath of the vessels. When the deep arch<br>
exists, its inner end blends with the conjoined tendon and Gimbernat's<br>
ligament, and with these may also constrict the femoral hernia.<br>
<br>
The sheath, <span style="font-style: italic;">e f, </span>of the
femoral vessels, E F, Fig. 1, Plate 43, passes<br>
from beneath the middle of the femoral arch. In this situation, the<br>
iliac part of the fascia lata, F G, Fig. 2, Plate 44, covers the sheath.<br>
Its inner side is bounded by Gimbernat's ligament, R, Fig. 1, Plate 44,<br>
and F, the falciform edge of the saphenous opening. On its outer side<br>
are situated the anterior crural nerve, and the femoral parts of the<br>
psoas and iliacus muscles. Of the three compartments into which the<br>
sheath is divided by two septa in its interior, the external one, E,<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 43, is occupied by the femoral artery; the middle one, F,<br>
by the femoral vein; whilst the inner one, G, gives passage to the<br>
femoral lymphatic vessels; and occasionally, also, a lymphatic body is<br>
found in it. The inner compartment, G, is the femoral canal, and through<br>
it the femoral hernia descends from the abdomen to the upper and<br>
forepart of the thigh. As the canal is the innermost of the three spaces<br>
inclosed by the sheath, it is that which lies in the immediate<br>
neighbourhood of the saphenous opening, Gimbernat's ligament, and the<br>
conjoined tendon, and between these structures and the femoral vein.<br>
<br>
The sheath of the femoral vessels, like that of the spermatic cord, is<br>
infundibuliform. Both are broader at their abdominal ends than<br>
elsewhere. The femoral sheath being broader above than below, whilst the<br>
vessels are of a uniform diameter, presents, as it were, a surplus space<br>
to receive a hernia into its upper end. This space is the femoral or<br>
crural canal. Its abdominal entrance is the femoral or crural ring.<br>
<br>
The femoral ring, H, Fig. 2, Plate 43, is, in the natural state of the<br>
parts, closed over by the peritonaeum, in the same manner as this<br>
membrane shuts the internal inguinal ring. There is, however,<br>
corresponding to each ring, a depression in the peritonaeal covering;<br>
and here it is that the bowel first forces the membrane and forms of<br>
this part its sac.<br>
<br>
On removing the peritonaeum from the inguinal wall on the inner side of<br>
the iliac vessels, K L, we find the horizontal branch of the os pubis,<br>
and the parts connected with it above and below, to be still covered by<br>
what is called the subserous tissue. The femoral ring is not as yet<br>
discernible on the inner side of the iliac vein, K; for the subserous<br>
tissue being stretched across this aperture masks it. The portion of the<br>
tissue which closes the ring is named the crural septum, (Cloquet.) When<br>
we remove this part, we open the femoral ring leading to the<br>
corresponding canal. The ring is the point of union between the fibrous<br>
membrane of the canal and the general fibrous membrane which lines the<br>
abdominal walls external to the peritonaeum. This account of the<br>
continuity between the canal and abdominal fibrous membrane equally<br>
applies to the connexion existing between the general sheath of the<br>
vessels and the abdominal membrane. The difference exists in the fact,<br>
that the two outer compartments of the sheath are occupied by the<br>
vessels, whilst the inner one is vacant. The neck or inlet of the<br>
hernial sac, H, Fig. 2, Plate 43, exactly represents the natural form of<br>
the crural ring, as formed in the fibrous membrane external to, or (as<br>
seen in this view) beneath the peritonaeum.<br>
<br>
The femoral ring, H, is girt round on all sides by a dense fibrous<br>
circle, the upper arc being formed by the two femoral arches; the outer<br>
arc is represented by the septum of the femoral sheath, which separates<br>
the femoral vein from the canal; the inner arc is formed by the united<br>
dense fibrous bands of the conjoined tendon and Gimbernat's ligament;<br>
and the inferior arc is formed by the pelvic fascia where this passes<br>
over the pubic bone to unite with the under part of the femoral canal<br>
and sheath. The ring thus bound by dense resisting fibrous structure, is<br>
rendered sharp on its pubic and upper sides by the salient edges of the<br>
conjoined tendon and Gimbernat's ligament, &amp;c. From the femoral
ring the<br>
canal extends down the thigh for an inch and a-half or two inches in a<br>
tapering form, supported by the pectineus muscle, and covered by the<br>
iliac part of the fascia lata. It lies side by side with the saphenous<br>
opening, but does not communicate with this place. On a level with the<br>
lower cornu of the saphenous opening, the walls of the canal become<br>
closely applied to the femoral vessels, and here it may be said to<br>
terminate.<br>
<br>
The bloodvessels which pass in the neighbourhood of the femoral canal<br>
are, 1st. the femoral vein, F, Fig. 1, Plate 43, which enclosed in its<br>
proper sheath lies parallel with and close to the outer side of the<br>
passage. 2nd, Within the inguinal canal above are the spermatic vessels,<br>
resting on the upper surface of the femoral arch, which alone separates<br>
them from the upper part or entrance of the femoral canal. 3rd, The<br>
epigastric artery, F, Fig. 2, Plate 43, which passes close to the outer<br>
and upper border of, H, the femoral ring. This vessel occasionally gives<br>
off the obturator artery, which, when thus derived, will be found to<br>
pass towards the obturator foramen, in close connexion with the ring;<br>
that is, either descending by its outer border, G*, between this point<br>
and the iliac vein, K; or arching the ring, G, so as to pass down close<br>
to its inner or pubic border. In some instances, the vessel crosses the<br>
ring; a vein generally accompanies the artery. These peculiarities in<br>
the origin and course of the obturator artery, especially that of<br>
passing on the pubic side of the ring, behind Gimbernat's ligament and<br>
the conjoined tendon, E H, are fortunately very rare.<br>
<br>
As the course to be taken by the bowel, when a femoral hernia is being<br>
formed, is through the crural ring and canal, the structures which have<br>
just now been enumerated as bounding this passage, will, of course, hold<br>
the like relation to the hernia. The manner in which a femoral hernia is<br>
formed, and the way in which it becomes invested in its descent, may be<br>
briefly stated thus: The bowel first dilates the peritonaeum opposite<br>
the femoral ring, H, Fig. 2, Plate 43, and pushes this membrane before<br>
it into the canal. This covering is the hernial sac. The crural septum<br>
has, at the same time, entered the canal as a second investment of the<br>
bowel. The hernia is now enclosed by the sheath, G, Fig. 1, Plate 43, of<br>
the canal itself. [Footnote 1] Its further progress through the<br>
saphenous opening, B F, Fig. 1, Plate 44, must be made either by<br>
rupturing the weak inner wall of the canal, or by dilating this part; in<br>
one or other of these modes, the herniary sac emerges from the canal<br>
through the saphenous opening. In general, it dilates the side of the<br>
canal, and this becomes the fascia propria, B G. If it have ruptured the<br>
canal, the hernial sac appears devoid of this covering. In either case,<br>
the hernia, increasing in size, turns up over the margin of F, the<br>
falciform process, [Footnote 2] and ultimately rests upon the iliac<br>
fascia lata, below the pubic third of Poupart's ligament. Sometimes the<br>
hernia rests upon this ligament, and simulates, to all outward<br>
appearance, an oblique inguinal hernia. In this course, the femoral<br>
hernia will have its three parts--neck, body, and fundus--forming nearly<br>
right angles with each other: its neck [Footnote 3] descends the crural<br>
canal, its body is directed to the pubis through the saphenous opening,<br>
and its fundus is turned upwards to the femoral arch.<br>
<br>
[Footnote 1: The sheath of the canal, together with the crural septum,<br>
constitutes the "fascia propria" of the hernia (Sir Astley Cooper). Mr.<br>
Lawrence denies the existence of the crural septum.]<br>
<br>
[Footnote 2:&nbsp; The "upper cornu of the saphenous opening," the
"falciform<br>
process" (Burns), and the "femoral ligament" (Hey), are names applied to<br>
the same part. With what difficulty and perplexity does this<br>
impenetrable fog of surgical nomenclature beset the progress of the<br>
learner!]<br>
<br>
[Footnote 3: The neck of the sac at the femoral ring lies very deep, in<br>
the undissected state of the parts (Lawrence).]<br>
<br>
The crural hernia is much more liable to suffer constriction than the<br>
inguinal hernia. The peculiar sinuous course which the former takes from<br>
its point of origin, at the crural ring, to its place on Poupart's<br>
ligament, and the unyielding fibrous structures which form the canal<br>
through which it passes, fully account for the more frequent occurrence<br>
of this casualty. The neck of the sac may, indeed, be supposed always to<br>
suffer more or less constriction at the crural ring. The part which<br>
occupies the canal is also very much compressed; and again, where the<br>
hernia turns over the falciform process, this structure likewise must<br>
cause considerable compression on the bowel in the sac. [Footnote] This<br>
hernia suffers stricture of the passive kind always; for the dense<br>
fibrous bands in its neighbourhood compress it rather by withstanding<br>
the force of the herniary mass than by reacting upon it. There are no<br>
muscular fibres crossing the course of this hernia; neither are the<br>
parts which constrict it likely to change their original position,<br>
however long it may exist. In the inguinal hernia, the weight of the<br>
mass may in process of time widen the canal by gravitating; but the<br>
crural hernia, resting on the pubic bone, cannot be supposed to dilate<br>
the crural ring, however greatly the protrusion may increase in size and<br>
weight.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Sir A. Cooper (Crural Hernia) is of opinion that the<br>
stricture is generally in the neck of the sheath. Mr. Lawrence remarks,<br>
"My own observations of the subject have led me to refer the cause of<br>
stricture to the thin posterior border (Gimbernat's ligament) of the<br>
crural arch, at the part where it is connected to the falciform<br>
process." (Op. cit.) This statement agrees also with the experience of<br>
