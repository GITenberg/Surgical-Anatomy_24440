<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATES 52 &amp; 53.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE DEEP STRUCTURES OF THE MALE PERINAEUM.<br>
<br>
THE LATERAL OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY.<br>
<br>
The urethra, at its membranous part, M, Fig. 1, Plate 53, which<br>
commences behind the bulb, perforates the centre of the deep perinaeal<br>
fascia, E E, at about an inch and a half in front of F, the anus. The<br>
anterior layer of the fascia is continued forwards over the bulb, whilst<br>
the posterior layer is reflected backwards over the prostate gland.<br>
<br>
Behind the deep perinaeal fascia, the anterior fibres of K, the levator<br>
ani muscle, arise from either side of the pubic symphysis posteriorly,<br>
and descend obliquely down wards and forwards, to be inserted into the<br>
sides of N N, the rectum above the anus. These fibres of the muscle, and<br>
the lower border of the fascia which covers them, lie immediately in<br>
front of the prostate, C C, Fig. 2, Plate 53, and must necessarily be<br>
divided in the operation of lithotomy. Previously to disturbing the<br>
lower end of the rectum from its natural position in the perinaeum, its<br>
close relation to the prostate and base of the bladder should be<br>
noticed. While the anus remains connected with the deep perinaeal fascia<br>
in front, the fibres of the levator ani muscle of the left side may be<br>
divided; and by now inserting the finger between them and the rectum,<br>
the left lobe of the prostate can be felt in apposition with the<br>
forepart of the bowel, an inch or two above the anus. It is owing to<br>
this connexion between these parts that the lithotomist has to depress<br>
the bowel, lest it be wounded, while the prostate is being incised. If<br>
either the bowel or the bladder, or both together, be over-distended,<br>
they are brought into closer apposition, and the rectum is consequently<br>
more exposed to danger during the latter stages of the operation. The<br>
prostate being in contact with the rectum, the surgeon is enabled to<br>
examine by the touch, <span style="font-style: italic;">per anum</span>,
the state of the gland. If the prostate<br>
be diseased and irregularly enlarged, the urethra, which passes through<br>
it, becomes, in general, so distorted, that the surgeon, after passing<br>
the catheter along the urethra as far as the prostate, will find it<br>
necessary to guide the point of the instrument into the bladder, by the<br>
finger introduced into the bowel. The middle or third lobe of the<br>
prostate being enlarged, bends the prostatic part of the urethra<br>
upwards. But when either of the lateral lobes is enlarged, the urethra<br>
becomes bent towards the opposite side.<br>
<br>
By dividing the levator ani muscle on both sides of the rectum, F, Fig.<br>
2, Plate 53, and detaching and depressing this from the perinaeal<br>
centre, the prostate, C C, and base of the bladder, P, are brought into<br>
view. The pelvic fascia may be now felt reflected from the inner surface<br>
of the levator ani muscle to the bladder at a level corresponding with<br>
the base of the prostate, and the neck of the bladder in front, and the<br>
vesiculae seminales, N N, laterally. In this manner the pelvic fascia<br>
serves to insulate the perinaeal space from the pelvic cavity. The<br>
prostate occupies the centre of the perinaeum. If the perinaeum were to<br>
be penetrated at a point midway between the bulb of the urethra and the<br>
anus, and to the depth of two inches straight backwards, the instrument<br>
would transfix the apex of the gland. Its left lobe lies directly under<br>
the middle of the line of incision which the lithotomist makes through<br>
the surface; a fibrous membrane forms a capsule for the gland, and<br>
renders its surface tough and unyielding, but its proper substance is<br>
friable, and may be lacerated or dilated with ease, after having partly<br>
incised its fibrous envelope. The membranous part of the urethra, M,<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 53, enters the apex of the prostate, and traverses this<br>
part in a line, nearer to the upper than to the under surface; and that<br>
portion of the canal which the gland surrounds, is named prostatic. The<br>
prostate is separated from the pudic artery by the levator ani muscle,<br>
and from the artery of the bulb, by the deep perinaeal fascia and the<br>
muscular fibres enclosed between its two layers.<br>
<br>
The prostate being a median structure, is formed of two lobes, united at<br>
the median line. The bulbus urethrae being also a median structure, is<br>
occasionally found notched in the centre, and presenting a bifid<br>
appearance. On the base of the bladder, P, Fig. 2, Plate 53, the two<br>
vasa deferentia, Q Q, are seen to converge from behind forwards, and<br>
enter the base of the gland; a triangular interval is thus formed<br>
between the vasa, narrower before than behind, and at the middle of this<br>
place the point of the trocar is to be passed (through the rectum,) for<br>
the purpose of evacuating the contents of the bladder, when other<br>
measures fail. When this operation is required to be performed, the<br>
situation of the prostate is first to be ascertained through the bowel;<br>
and at a distance of an inch behind the posterior border of the gland,<br>
precisely in the median line, the distended base of the bladder may be<br>
safely punctured. If the trocar pierce the bladder at this point, the<br>
seminal vessels converging to the prostate from either side, and the<br>
recto-vesical serous pouch behind, will escape being wounded. If the<br>
prostate happen to be much enlarged, the relative position of the<br>
neighbouring parts will be found disturbed, and in such case the bladder<br>
can be punctured above the pubes with greater ease and safety. In cases<br>
of <span style="font-style: italic;">impassable</span> stricture, when
extravasation of urine is threatened, or<br>
has already occurred, the urethra should be opened in the perinaeum<br>
behind the place where the stricture is situated, and this (in the<br>
present instance) certainly seems to be the more effectual measure, for<br>
at the same time that the stricture is divided, the contents of the<br>
bladder may be evacuated through the perinaeum. If the membranous part<br>
of the urethra be that where the stricture exists, a staff with a<br>
central groove is to be passed as far as the strictured part, and having<br>
ascertained the position of the instrument by the finger in the bowel,<br>
the perinaeum should be incised, at the middle line, between the bulb of<br>
the urethra and the anus. The urethra in this situation will be found to<br>
curve backwards at the depth of an inch or more from the surface. The<br>
point of the staff is now to be felt for, and the urethra is to be<br>
incised upon it. The bistoury is next to be carried backwards through<br>
the stricture till it enters that part of the urethra (usually dilated<br>
in such cases) which intervenes between the seat of obstruction and the<br>
neck of the bladder.<br>
<br>
The lateral operation of lithotomy is to be performed according to the<br>
above described anatomical relations of the parts concerned. The bowel<br>
being empty and the bladder moderately full, a staff with a groove in<br>
its left side is to be passed by the urethra into the bladder. The<br>
position and size of the prostate is next to be ascertained by the left<br>
fore-finger in the rectum. Having now explored the surface of the<br>
perinaeum in order to determine the situation of the left tuberosity and<br>
ischio-pubic ramus, in relation to the perinaeal middle line, the staff<br>
being held steadily against the symphysis pubis, the operator proceeds<br>
to divide the skin and superficial fascia on the left side of the<br>
perinaeum, commencing the incision on the left of the raphe about an<br>
inch in front of the anus, and carrying it downwards and outwards midway<br>
between the anus and ischiatic tuberosity, to a point below these parts.<br>
The left fore-finger is then to be passed along the incision for the<br>
purpose of parting the loose cellular tissue; and any of the more<br>
resisting structures, such as the transverse and levator ani muscles,<br>
are to be divided by the knife. Deep in the forepart of the wound, the<br>
position of the staff is now to be felt for, and the structures which<br>
cover the membranous portion of the urethra are to be cautiously<br>
divided. Recollecting now that the artery of the bulb passes anterior to<br>
the staff in the urethra on a level with the bulb, the vessel is to be<br>
avoided by inserting the point of the knife in the groove of the staff<br>
as far backwards--that is, as near the apex of the prostate--as<br>
possible. The point of the knife having been inserted in the groove of<br>
the staff, the bowel is then to be depressed by the left fore-finger;<br>
and now the knife, with its back to the staff, and its edge lateralized<br>
(towards the lower part of the left tuber ischii), is to be pushed<br>
steadily along the groove in the direction of the staff, and made to<br>
divide the membranous part of the urethra and the anterior two-thirds of<br>
the left lobe of the prostate. The gland must necessarily be divided to<br>
this extent if the part of the urethra which it surrounds be traversed<br>
by the knife. The extent to which the prostate is divided depends upon<br>
the degree of the angle which the knife, passing along the urethra,<br>
makes with the staff. The greater this angle is, the greater the extent<br>
to which the gland will be incised. The knife being next withdrawn, the<br>
left fore-finger is to be passed through the opening into the bladder,<br>
and the parts are to be dilated by the finger as it proceeds, guided by<br>
the staff. The staff is now to be removed while the point of the finger<br>
is in the neck of the bladder, and the forceps is to be passed into the<br>
bladder along the finger as a guide. The calculus, now in the grip of<br>
the forceps, is to be extracted by a slow undulating motion.<br>
<br>
The general rules to be remembered and adopted in performing the<br>
operation of lithotomy are as follow:--1st, The incision through the<br>
skin and sub-cutaneous cellular membrane should be freely made, in order<br>
that the stone may be easily extracted and the urine have ready egress.<br>
The incision which (judging from the anatomical relations of the parts)<br>
appears to be best calculated to effect these objects, is one which<br>
would extend from a point an inch above the anus to a point in the<br>
posterior perinaeal space an inch or more below the anus. The wound thus<br>
made would <span style="font-style: italic;">depend in relation to the
neck of the bladder;</span> the important<br>
parts, vessels, &amp;c., in the anterior perinaeal space would be
avoided<br>
where the incision, if extended upwards, would have no effect whatever<br>
in facilitating the extraction of the stone or the egress of the urine;<br>
and what is also of prime importance, the external opening would<br>
directly correspond with the incision through the prostate and neck of<br>
the bladder. 2nd, After the incision through the skin and superficial<br>
fascia is made, the operator should separate as many of the deeper<br>
structures as will admit of it, by the finger rather than by the knife;<br>
and especially use the knife cautiously towards the extremities of the<br>
wound, so as to avoid the artery of the bulb, and the bulb itself in the<br>
upper part, and the rectum below. The pudic artery will not be<br>
endangered if the deeper parts be divided by the knife, with its edge<br>
directed downwards and outwards, while its point slides securely along<br>
the staff in the prostate. 3rd, The prostate should be incised<br>
sparingly, for, in addition to the known fact that the gland when only<br>
partly cut admits of dilatation to a degree sufficient to admit the<br>
passage of even a stone of large size, it is also stated upon high<br>
authority that by incising the prostate and neck of the bladder to a<br>
length equal to the diameter of the stone, such a proceeding is more<br>
frequently followed with disastrous results, owing to the circumstance<br>
that the pelvic fascia being divided at the place where it is reflected<br>
upon the base of the gland and the side and neck of the bladder, allows<br>
the urine to infiltrate the cellular tissue of the pelvis. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
<br>
[Footnote: "The object in following this method," Mr. Liston observes,<br>
"is to avoid all interference with the reflexion of the ilio-vesical<br>
fascia from the sides of the pelvic cavity over the base of the gland<br>
and side of the bladder. If this natural boundary betwixt the external<br>
and internal cellular tissue is broken up, there is scarcely a<br>
possibility of preventing infiltration of the urine, which must almost<br>
certainly prove fatal. The prostate and other parts around the neck of<br>
the bladder are very elastic and yielding, so that without much solution<br>
of their continuity, and without the least laceration, the opening can<br>
be so dilated as to admit the fore-finger readily through the same<br>
wound; the forceps can be introduced upon this as a guide, and they can<br>
also be removed along with a stone of considerable dimensions, say from<br>
three to nearly five inches in circumference, in one direction, and from<br>
four to six in the largest."--<span style="font-style: italic;">Practical
Surgery</span>, page 510. This doctrine<br>
(founded, no doubt, on Mr. Liston's own great experience) coincides with<br>
that first expressed by Scarpa, Le Cat, and others. Sir Benjamin Brodie,<br>
Mr. Stanley, and Mr. Syme are also advocates for limited incisions,<br>
extending no farther than a partial division of the prostate, the rest<br>
being effected by dilatation. The experience, however, of Cheselden,<br>
Martineau, and Mr. S. Cooper, inclined them in favour of a rather free<br>
incision of the prostate and neck of the bladder proportioned to the<br>
size of the calculus, so that this may be extracted freely, without<br>
lacerating or contusing the parts, "and," says the distinguished<br>
lithotomist Klein, "upon this basis rests the success of my operations;<br>
and hence I invariably make it a rule to let the incision be rather too<br>
large than too small, and never to dilate it with any blunt instrument<br>
when it happens to be too diminutive, but to enlarge it with a knife,<br>
introduced, if necessary, several times."--<span

<span style="font-style: italic;">Bedeutendsten Chirurgische Operationen</span>.
Opinions of the highest<br>
authority being thus opposed, in reference to the question whether free<br>
or limited incisions in the neck of the bladder are followed<br>
respectively by the greater number of fatal or favourable results, and<br>
these being thought mainly to depend upon whether the pelvic fascia be<br>
opened or not, one need not hesitate to conclude, that since facts seem<br>
to be noticed in support of both modes of practice equally, the issue of<br>
the cases themselves must really be dependent upon other circumstances,<br>
such as the state of the constitution, the state of the bladder, and the<br>
relative position of the internal and external incisions. "Some<br>
individuals (observes Sir B. Brodie) are good subjects for the<br>
operation, and recover perhaps without a bad symptom, although the<br>
operation may have been very indifferently performed. Others may be<br>
truly said to be bad subjects, and die, even though the operation be<br>
performed in the most perfect manner. What is it that constitutes the<br>
essential difference between these two classes of cases? It is,<br>
according to my experience, the presence or absence of organic<br>
disease."--<span style="font-style: italic;">Diseases of the Urinary
Organs</span>.]<br>
<br>
The position in which the staff is held while the membranous urethra and<br>
prostate are being divided should be regulated by the operator himself.<br>
If he requires the perinaeum to be protruded and the urethra directed<br>
towards the place of the incision, he can effect this by depressing the<br>
handle of the instrument a little towards the right groin, taking care<br>
at the same time that the point is kept beyond the prostate in the<br>
interior of the bladder.<br>
