<big><big>SURGICAL ANATOMY by JOSEPH MACLISE<br>
<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATES 59 &amp; 60.<br>
<br>
THE VARIOUS FORMS AND POSITIONS OF STRICTURES AND OTHER<br>
OBSTRUCTIONS OF THE URETHRA.--FALSE PASSAGES.--ENLARGEMENTS<br>
AND DEFORMITIES OF THE PROSTATE.<br>
<br>
Impediments to the passage of the urine through the urethra may arise<br>
from different causes, such as the impaction of a small calculus in the<br>
canal, or any morbid growth (a polypus, &amp;c.) being situated
therein, or<br>
from an abscess which, though forming externally to the urethra, may<br>
press upon this tube so as either to obstruct it partially, by bending<br>
one of its sides towards the other, or completely, by surrounding the<br>
canal on all sides. These causes of obstruction may happen in any part<br>
of the urethra, but there are two others (the prostatic and the<br>
spasmodic) which are, owing to anatomical circumstances, necessarily<br>
confined to the posterior two-thirds of the urethra. The portion of the<br>
urethra surrounded by the prostate can alone be obstructed by this body<br>
when it has become irregularly enlarged, while the spasmodic stricture<br>
can only happen to the membranous portion of the urethra, and to an inch<br>
or two of the canal anterior to the bulb, these being the parts which<br>
are embraced by muscular structures. The urethra itself not being<br>
muscular, cannot give rise to the spasmodic form of stricture. But that<br>
kind of obstruction which is common to all parts of the urethra, and<br>
which is dependent, as well upon the structures of which the canal is<br>
uniformly composed, as upon the circumstance that inflammation may<br>
attack these in any situation and produce the same effect, is the<br>
permanent or organic stricture. Of this disease the forms are as various<br>
as the situations are, for as certainly as it may reasonably be supposed<br>
that the plastic lymph, effused in an inflamed state of the urethra from<br>
any cause, does not give rise to stricture of any special or particular<br>
form, exclusive of all others; so as certainly may it be inferred that,<br>
in a structurally uniform canal, inflammation points to no one<br>
particular place of it, whereat by preference to establish the organic<br>
stricture. The membranous part of the canal is, however, mentioned as<br>
being the situation most prone to the disease; but I have little doubt,<br>
nevertheless, that owing to general rules of this kind being taken for<br>
granted, upon imposing authority, many more serious evils (false<br>
passages, &amp;c.) have been effected by catheterism than existed
previous<br>
to the performance of this operation.[Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Home describes "a natural constriction of the urethra,<br>
directly behind the bulb, which is probably formed with a power of<br>
contraction to prevent," &amp;c. This is the part which he says is "most<br>
liable to the disease of stricture." (<span style="font-style: italic;">Strictures
of the Urethra</span>.) Now,<br>
if anyone, even among the acute observing microscopists, can discern the<br>
structure to which Home alludes, he will certainly prove this anatomist<br>
to be a marked exception amongst those who, for the enforcement of any<br>
doctrine, can see any thing or phenomenon they wish to see. And, if<br>
Hunter were as the mirror from which Home's mind was reflected, then the<br>
observation must be imputed to the Great Original. Upon the question,<br>
however, as to which is the most frequent seat of stricture, I find that<br>
both these anatomists do not agree, Hunter stating that its usual seat<br>
is just in front of the bulb, while Home regrets, as it were, to be<br>
obliged to differ from "his immortal friend," and avers its seat to be<br>
an infinitesimal degree behind the bulb. Sir A. Cooper again, though<br>
arguing that the most usual situation of stricture is that mentioned by<br>
Hunter, names, as next in order of frequency, strictures of the<br>
membranous and prostatic parts of the urethra. Does it not appear<br>
strange now, how questions of this import should have occupied so much<br>
of the serious attention of our great predecessors, and of those, too,<br>
who at the present time form the vanguard of the ranks of science? Upon<br>
what circumstance, either anatomical or pathological, can one part of<br>
the urethra be more liable to the organic stricture than another?]<br>
<br>
Figs. 1 and 2, Plate 59.--In these figures are presented seven forms of<br>
organic stricture occurring, in different parts of the urethra. In <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,<br>
Fig. 1, the mucous membrane is thrown into a sharp circular fold, in the<br>
centre of which the canal, appears much contracted; a section of this<br>
stricture appears in <span style="font-style: italic;">b,</span> Fig.
2. In <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, Fig. 1, the canal is
contracted<br>
laterally by a prominent fold of the mucous membrane at the opposite<br>
side. In c, Fig. 1, an organized band of lymph is stretched across the<br>
canal; this stricture is seen in section in c, Fig. 2. In <span
 style="font-style: italic;">e</span>, Fig. 1, a<br>
stellate band of organized lymph, attached by pedicles to three sides of<br>
the urethra, divides the canal into three passages. In <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, Fig. 1, the<br>
canal is seen to be much contracted towards the left side by a<br>
crescentic fold of the lining membrane projecting from the right. In <span
 style="font-style: italic;">f,</span><br>
the canal appears contracted by a circular membrane, perforated in the<br>
centre; a section of which is seen at <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,
Fig. 2. The form of the organic<br>
stricture varies therefore according to the three following<br>
circumstances:--1st. When lymph becomes effused within the canal upon<br>
the surface of the lining mucous membrane, and contracts adhesions<br>
across the canal. 2ndly. When lymph is effused external to the lining<br>
membrane, and projects this inwards, thereby narrowing the diameter of<br>
the canal. 3rdly. When the outer and inner walls of a part of the<br>
urethra are involved in the effused organizable matter, and on<br>
contracting towards each other, encroach at the same time upon the area<br>
of the canal. This latter state presents the form, which is known as the<br>
old callous tough stricture, extending in many instances for an inch or<br>
more along the canal. In cases where the urethra becomes obstructed by<br>
tough bands of substance, <span style="font-style: italic;">c e,</span>
which cross the canal directly, the<br>
points of flexible catheters, especially if these be of slender shape,<br>
are apt to be bent upon the resisting part, and on pressure being<br>
continued, the operator may be led to suppose that the instrument<br>
traverses the stricture, while it is most probably perforating the wall<br>
of the urethra. But in those cases where the diameter of the canal is<br>
circularly contracted, the stricture generally presents a conical<br>
depression in front, which, receiving the point of the instrument,<br>
allows this to enter the central passage unerringly. A stricture formed<br>
by a crescentic septum, such as is seen in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b d</span>, Fig. 1, offers a more<br>
effectual obstacle to the passage of a catheter than the circular septum<br>
like <span style="font-style: italic;">a f</span>.<br>

Fig. 3, Plate 59.--In this there are seen three separate strictures, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a,</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">b, c</span>, situated in the urethra,
anterior to the bulb. In some cases there<br>
are many more strictures (even to the number of six or seven) situated<br>
in various parts of the urethra; and it is observed that when one<br>
stricture exists, other slight tightnesses in different parts of the<br>
canal frequently attend it. (Hunter.) When several strictures occur in<br>
various parts of the urethra, they may occasion as much difficulty in<br>
passing an instrument as if the whole canal between the extreme<br>
constrictions were uniformly narrowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="images/132P59F3_25.jpg"><img alt=""

 style="border: 2px solid ; width: 677px; height: 157px;"></a><br>
Plate 59.--Figure 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 4, Plate 59.--In this the canal is constricted at the point <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a,</span><br>
midway between the bulb and glans. A false passage has been made under<br>
the urethra by an instrument which passed out of the canal at the point<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>, anterior to the stricture <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, and re-entered the canal at the
point <span style="font-style: italic;">c,</span><br>
anterior to the bulb. When a false passage of this kind happens to be<br>
made, it will become a permanent outlet for the urine, so long as the<br>
stricture remains. For it can be of no avail that we avoid re-opening<br>
the anterior perforation by the catheter, so long as the urine prevented<br>
from flowing by the natural canal enters the posterior perforation.<br>
Measures should be at once taken to remove the stricture.<br>
<br>

Plate 59.--Figure 4.<br>
<br>
Fig. 5, Plate 59.--The stricture <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>
appears midway between the bulb and<br>
glans, the area of the passage through the stricture being sufficient<br>
only to admit a bristle to pass. It would seem almost impossible to pass<br>
a catheter through a stricture so close as this, unless by a laceration<br>
of the part, combined with dilatation.<br>

Fig. 6, Plate 59.--Two instruments, <span style="font-style: italic;">a,
b,</span> have made false passages<br>
beneath the mucous membrane, in a case where no stricture at all<br>
existed. The resistance which the instruments encountered in passing out<br>
of the canal having been mistaken, no doubt, for that of passing through<br>
a close stricture.<br>

appears tearing and passing beneath<br>
the lining membrane, <span style="font-style: italic;">d d</span>, of
the prostatic urethra. It is remarked that<br>
the origin of a false passage is in general anterior to the stricture.<br>
It may, however, occur at any part of the canal in which no stricture<br>
exists, if the hand that impels the instrument be not guided by a true<br>
knowledge of the form of the urethra; and perhaps the accident happening<br>
from this cause is the more general rule of the two.<br>

other, <span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>, an inch anterior to
this part. In the<br>
prostate, <span style="font-style: italic;">a b</span>, are seen
irregularly shaped abscess pits, communicating<br>
with each other, and projecting upwards the floor of this body to such a<br>
degree, that the prostatic canal appears nearly obliterated.<br>

are seen to enter the upper wall<br>
of the urethra, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, anterior
to the prostate, <span style="font-style: italic;">a b.</span> This
accident happens<br>
when the handle of a rigid instrument is depressed too soon, with the<br>

which body the three lobes, <span style="font-style: italic;">a, b, c</span>,
are much enlarged. The instrument <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span><br>
perforates the third lobe, <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>;
while the instrument <span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>
penetrates the<br>
right lobe, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, and the third
lobe, <span style="font-style: italic;">a.</span> This accident occurs
when<br>
instruments not possessing the proper prostatic bend are forcibly pushed<br>
forwards against the resistance at the neck of the bladder.<br>

<br>
<br>
Fig. 12, Plate 59.--In this case an instrument, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d d</span>, after passing<br>
beneath part of the lining membrane, <span style="font-style: italic;">e
e,</span> anterior to the bulb,<br>
penetrates <span style="font-style: italic;">b,</span> the right lobe
of the prostate. A second instrument, <span style="font-style: italic;">c
c,</span><br>
penetrates the left lobe. A third smaller instrument, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">f f,</span> is seen to<br>
pass out of the urethra anterior to the prostate, and after transfixing<br>
the right vesicula seminalis external to the neck of the bladder, enters<br>
this viscus at a point behind the prostate. The resistance which the two<br>
larger instruments met with in penetrating the prostate, made it seem,<br>
perhaps, that a tight stricture existed in this situation, to match<br>
which the smaller instrument, <span style="font-style: italic;">f f,</span>
was afterwards passed in the course<br>
marked out.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 59.--Figure 12.<br>
<br>
<br>
Figs. 1 to 5, Plate 60, represent a series of prostates, in which the<br>
third lobe gradually increases in size. In Fig. 1, which shows the<br>
healthy state of the neck of the bladder, unmarked by the prominent<br>
lines which are said to bound the space named "trigone vesical," or by<br>
those which indicate the position of the "muscles of the ureters," the<br>
third lobe does not exist. In Fig. 2 it appears as the uvula vesicae, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>.<br>
In Fig. 3 the part <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span> is
increased, and under the name now of third lobe<br>
is seen to contract and bend upwards the prostatic canal. In Fig. 4 the<br>
effect which the growth of the lobe, <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,
produces upon the form of the<br>
neck of the bladder becomes more marked, and the part presenting<br>
perforations, <span style="font-style: italic;">e e</span>, produced
by instruments, indicates that by its shape<br>
it became an obstacle to the egress of the urine as well as to the<br>
entrance of instruments. A calculus of irregular form is seen to lodge<br>
behind the third lobe, and to be out of the reach of the point of a<br>
sound, supposing this to enter the bladder over the apex of the lobe. In<br>
Fig. 5 the three lobes are enlarged, but the third is most so, and while<br>
standing on a narrow pedicle attached to the floor of the prostate,<br>
completely blocks up the neck of the bladder. [Footnote]<br>

</big></big><big><big>[Footnote: On comparing this series of figures,
it must appear that the<br>
third lobe of the prostate is the product of diseased action,&nbsp; in
so far<br>
at least as an unnatural hypertrophy of a part may be so designated. It<br>
is not proper to the bladder in the healthy state of this organ, and<br>
where it does manifest itself by increase it performs no healthy<br>
function in the economy. When Home, therefore, described this part as a<br>
new fact in anatomy, he had in reality as little reason for so doing as<br>
he would have had in naming any other tumour, a thing unknown to normal<br>
anatomy. Langenbeck (Neue Bibl. b. i. p. 360) denies its existence in<br>
the healthy state. Cruveilhier (Anat. Pathog. liv. xxvii.) deems it<br>
incorrect to reckon a third lobe as proper to the healthy bladder.]<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 6, Plate 60.--The prostatic canal is bent upwards by the enlarged<br>
third lobe to such a degree as to form a right angle with the membranous<br>
part of the canal. A bougie is seen to perforate the third lobe, and<br>
this is the most frequent mode in which, under such circumstances, and<br>
with instruments of the usual imperfect form, access may be gained to<br>
the bladder for the relief of retention of urine. "The new passage may<br>
in every respect be as efficient as one formed by puncture or incision<br>
in any other way." (Fergusson.)<br>

Fig. 7, Plate 60.--The three lobes of the prostate, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a, b, c,</span> are equally<br>
enlarged. The prostatic canal is consequently much contracted and<br>
distorted, so that an instrument on being passed into the bladder has<br>
made a false passage through the third lobe. When a catheter is<br>
suspected to have entered the bladder by perforating the prostate, the<br>
instrument should be retained in the newly made passage till such time<br>
as this has assumed the cylindrical form of the instrument. If this be<br>
done, the new passage will be the more likely to become permanent. It is<br>
ascertained that all false passages and fistulae by which the urine<br>
escapes, become after a time lined with a membrane similar to that of<br>
the urethra. (Stafford.)<br>

projection behind, pressed upon the forepart of the rectum, and by its<br>
projection in front, contracted the area of the prostatic canal, and<br>
thereby caused an obstruction in this part. Not unfrequently when a<br>
catheter is passed along the urethra, for the relief of a retention of<br>
urine caused by the swell of an abscess in this situation, the sac<br>
becomes penetrated by the instrument, and, instead of urine, pus flows.<br>
The sac of a prostatic abscess frequently opens of its own accord into<br>
the neighbouring part of the urethra, and when this occurs it becomes<br>
necessary to retain a catheter in the neck of the bladder, so as to<br>
prevent the urine entering the sac.<br>

through it, from its apex to its base. The proper canal is bent upwards<br>
from its usual position, which is that at present marked by the<br>
instrument in the false passage.<br>

Fig. 12, Plate 60.--The prostatic lobes are uniformly enlarged, and<br>
cause the corresponding part of the urethra to be uniformly contracted,<br>

considerable resistance to the passage of the instrument.<br>

<br>
Fig. 13, Plate 60.--The prostate, <span style="font-style: italic;">bc</span>,
is considerably enlarged<br>
anteriorly, <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, in consequence
of which the prostatic canal appears more<br>
horizontal even than natural. The catheter, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, occupying the canal lies<br>
nearly straight. The lower wall, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>,
of the prostate is much diminished<br>
in thickness. A nipple-shaped process, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, is seen to be attached by a<br>
pedicle to the back of the upper part, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, of the prostate, and to act<br>
like a stopper to the neck of the bladder. The body <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span> being moveable, it<br>
will be perceived how, while the bladder is distended with urine, the<br>
pressure from above may block up the neck of the organ with this part,<br>
and thus cause complete retention, which, on the introduction of a<br>
catheter, becomes readily relieved by the instrument pushing the<br>
obstructing body aside.<br>
