COMMENTARY ON PLATES 39 &amp; 40.<br>
<br>
DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE NATURE OF CONGENITAL AND<br>
INFANTILE INGUINAL HERNIAE, AND OF HYDROCELE.<br>
<br>
PLATE 39. Fig. 1--<span style="font-style: italic;">The descent of the
testicle from the loins to the</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">scrotum</span>.--The foetal abdomen
and scrotum form one general cavity, and<br>
are composed of parts which are structurally identical. The cutaneous,<br>
fascial, muscular, and membranous layers of the abdominal parietes are<br>
continued into those of the scrotum. At the fifth month of foetal life,<br>
the testicle, 3, is situated in the loins beneath the kidney, 2. The<br>
testicle is then numbered amongst the abdominal viscera, and, like<br>
these, it is developed external to the peritonaeal membrane, which forms<br>
an envelope for it. At the back and sides of the testicle, where the<br>
peritonaeum is reflected from it, a small membranous fold or mesentery<br>
(mesorchium, <span style="font-style: italic;">Seiler)</span> is
formed, and between the layers of this the<br>
nerves and vessels enter the organ, the nerves being derived from the<br>
neighbouring sympathetic ganglia (aortic plexus), while the arteries and<br>
veins spring directly from the main abdominal bloodvessels. It being<br>
predetermined that the testicle, 3, should migrate from the loins to the<br>
scrotum, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">a,</span> 7, at a period
included between the sixth and ninth month,<br>
certain structural changes are at this time already effected for its<br>
sure and easy passage. By the time that the testis, 5, is about to enter<br>
the internal inguinal ring, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,
(seventh or eighth month,) a process or<br>
pouch of the peritonaeal membrane (processus vaginalis) has already<br>
descended through this aperture into the scrotum, and the testicle<br>
follows it.<br>
<br>
The descent of the testis is effected by a very slow and gradual process<br>
of change. (Tout va par degres dans la nature, et rien par<br>
sauts.--<span style="font-style: italic;">Bonnet.</span>) But how, or
by what distinct and active structural<br>
agent, this descent is effected, or whether there does exist, in fact,<br>
any such agent as that which anatomists name "gubernaculum testis," are<br>
questions which appear to me by no means settled.[Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote:&nbsp; Dr. Carpenter (Principles of Human Physiology)
remarks, that<br>
"the cause of this descent is not very clear. It can scarcely be due<br>
merely, as some have supposed, to the contraction of the gubernaculum,<br>
since that does not contain any fibrous structure until after the<br>
lowering of the testis has commenced." Dr. Sharpey (Quain's Anatomy, 5th<br>
edition) observes, that "the office of the gubernaculum is yet<br>
imperfectly understood." The opinions of these two distinguished<br>
physiologists will doubtless be regarded as an impartial estimate of the<br>
results of the researches prosecuted in reference to these questions by<br>
Haller, Camper, Hunter, Arnaud, Lobstein, Meckel, Paletta, Wrisberg,<br>
Vicq d'Azyr, Brugnone, Tumiati, Seiler, Girardi, Cooper, Bell, Weber,<br>
Carus, Cloquet, Curling, and others. From my own observations, I am led<br>
to believe that no such muscular structure as a gubernaculum exists, and<br>
therefore that the descent of the testis is the effect of another cause.<br>
Leaving these matters, however, to the consideration of the<br>
physiologist, it is sufficient for the surgeon to know that the testis<br>
in its transition derives certain coverings from the parietes of the<br>
groin, and that a communication is thereby established between the<br>
scrotal and abdominal cavities. ]<br>
<br>
The general lining membrane of the foetal abdomen is composed of two<br>
layers--an outer one of fibrous, and an inner one of serous structure.<br>
Of these two layers, the abdominal viscera form for themselves a double<br>
envelope. [Footnote]&nbsp; The testis in the loins has a covering from
both<br>
membranes, and is still found to be enclosed by both, even when it has<br>
descended to the scrotum. The two coverings of fibro-serous structure<br>
which surrounded the testis in the loins become respectively the tunica<br>
albuginea and tunica vaginalis when the gland occupies the scrotal<br>
cavity.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Langenbeck describes the peritonaeum as consisting of two<br>
layers; one external and fibrous, another internal and serous. By the<br>
first, he means, I presume, that membrane of which the transversalis and<br>
iliac fasciae are parts. (See Comment. de Periton. Structura, &amp;c.) ]<br>

Plate 39--Figure 1<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 39, Fig. 2.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The testicle in
the scrotum</span>.--When the testicle, 5,<br>
descends into the scrotum, 7, which happens in general at the time of<br>
birth, the abdomino-scrotal fibro-serous membrane, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, is still<br>
continuous at the internal ring, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>.
From this point downwards, to a<br>
level with the upper border of the testicle, the canal of communication<br>
between the scrotal cavity and the abdomen becomes elongated and<br>
somewhat constricted. At this part, the canal itself consists, like the<br>
abdominal membrane above and the scrotal membrane below, of a fibrous<br>
and serous layer, the latter enclosed within the former. The serous<br>
lining of this canal is destined to be obliterated, while the outer<br>
fibrous membrane is designed to remain in its primitive condition. When<br>
the serous canal contracts and degenerates to the form of a simple cord,<br>
it leaves the fibrous canal still continuous above with the fibrous<br>
membrane (transversalis fascia) of the abdomen, and below with the<br>
fibrous envelope (tunica albuginea) of the testis; and at the adult<br>
period, this fibrous canal is known as the internal spermatic sheath, or<br>
infundibuliform fascia enclosing the remains of the serous canal,<br>
together with the spermatic vessels, &amp;c.<br>

Plate 39--Figure 2<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 39, Fig. 3.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The serous tunica
vaginalis is separated from the</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">peritonaeum.</span>--When the
testicle, 7, has descended to the scrotum, the<br>
serous tube or lining of the inguinal canal and cord, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, closes<br>
and degenerates into a simple cord, (infantile spermatic cord,) and<br>
thereby the peritonaeal sac, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,
becomes distinct from the serous<br>
tunica vaginalis, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>. But
the fibrous tube, or outer envelope of the<br>
inguinal canal, remains still pervious, and continues in this condition<br>
throughout life. In the adult, we recognise this fibrous tube as the<br>
infundibuliform fascia of the cord, or as forming the fascia propria of<br>
an external inguinal hernia. The anterior part of the fibrous spermatic<br>
tube descends from the fascia transversalis; the posterior part is<br>
continuous with the fascia iliaca. In relation to the testicle, the<br>
posterior part will be seen to be reflected over the body of the gland<br>
as the tunica albuginea, while the anterior part blends with the<br>
cellular tissue of the front wall of the scrotum. The tunica vaginalis,<br>
6 <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, is now traceable as a
distinct sac,[Footnote] closed on all sides,<br>
and reflected from the fore part of the testicle, above and below, to<br>
the posterior aspect of the front wall of the scrotum.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Mr. Owen states that the Chimpanzee alone, amongst brute<br>
animals, has the tunica vaginalis as a distinct sac.]<br>

Plate 39--Figure 3<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 40, Fig. 1.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The
abdomino-scrotal serous lining remains continuous</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">at the internal ring, and a
congenital hydrocele is formed.</span>--When the<br>
serous spermatic tube, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, 6
<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, remains pervious and
continuous above<br>
with the peritonaeum, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,
and below with the serous tunica vaginalis, 6<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, the serous fluid of the
abdomen will naturally gravitate to the most<br>
depending part--viz., the tunica vaginalis; and thus a hydrocele is<br>
formed. This kind of hydrocele is named congenital, owing to the<br>
circumstance that the natural process of obliteration, by which the<br>
peritonaeum becomes separated from the tunica vaginalis, has been, from<br>
some cause, arrested. [Footnote 1]&nbsp; As long as the canal of<br>
communication, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, between the tunica vaginalis, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, and the<br>
peritonaeum 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, remains
pervious, which it may be throughout life, this<br>
form of hydrocele is, of course, liable to occur. It may be diagnosed<br>
from diseased enlargements of the testicle, by its transparency, its<br>
fluctuation, and its smooth, uniform fulness and shape, besides its<br>
being of less weight than a diseased testis of the same size would be.<br>
It may be distinguished from the common form of hydrocele of the<br>
isolated tunica vaginalis by the fact, that pressure made on the scrotum<br>
will cause the fluid to pass freely into the general cavity of the<br>
peritonaeum. As the fluid distends the tunica vaginalis, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, in<br>
front of the testis, this organ will of course lie towards the back of<br>
the scrotum, and therefore, if it be found necessary to evacuate the<br>
fluid, the puncture may be made with most safety in front of the<br>
scrotum. If ascites should form in an adult in whom the tunica vaginalis<br>
still communicates with the peritonaeal sac, the fluid which accumulates<br>
in the latter membrane will also distend the former, and all the<br>
collected fluid may be evacuated by tapping the scrotum. When a<br>
hydrocele is found to be congenital, it must be at once obvious that to<br>
inject irritating fluids into the tunica vaginalis (the radical cure) is<br>
inadmissible. In an adult, free from all structural disease, and in whom<br>
a congenital hydrocele is occasioned by the gravitation of the ordinary<br>
serous secretion of the peritonaeum, a cure may be effected by causing<br>
the obliteration of the serous spermatic canal by the pressure of a<br>
truss. When a congenital hydrocele happens in an infant in whom the<br>
testicle, 5, Fig. 1, Plate 39, is arrested in the inguinal canal,<br>
[Footnote 2] if pressure be made on this passage with a view of causing<br>
its closure, the testicle will be prevented from descending.<br>
<br>
[Footnote 1: The serous spermatic tube remains open in all quadrupeds;<br>
but their natural prone position renders them secure against hydrocele<br>
or hernial protrusion. It is interesting to notice how in man, and the<br>
most anthropo-morphous animals, where the erect position would subject<br>
these to the frequent accident of hydrocele or hernia, nature causes the<br>
serous spermatic tube to close.]<br>
<br>
[Footnote 2: In many quadrupeds (the Rodentia and Monotremes) the testes<br>
remain within the abdomen. In the Elephant, the testes always occupy<br>
their original position beneath the kidneys, in the loins. Human adults<br>
are occasionally found to be "testi-conde;" the testes being situated<br>
below the kidneys, or at some part between this position and the<br>
internal inguinal ring. Sometimes only one of the testes descends to the<br>
scrotum.]<br>

Plate 40--Figure 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 40, Fig. 2.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The serous
spermatic canal closes imperfectly, so as</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">to become sacculated, and thus a
hydrocele of the cord is formed.</span>--After<br>
the testicle, 7, has descended to the scrotum, the sides of the serous<br>
tube, or lining of the inguinal canal and cord, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c,</span> may become<br>
adherent at intervals; and the intervening sacs of serous membrane<br>
continuing to secrete their proper fluid, will occasion a hydrocele of<br>
the cord. This form of hydrocele will differ according to the varieties<br>
in the manner of closure; and these may take place in the following<br>
modes:--1st, if the serous tube close only at the internal ring, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,<br>
while the lower part of it, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>,
6 <span style="font-style: italic;">c,</span> remains pervious, and<br>
communicating with the tunica vaginalis, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, a hydrocele will be formed<br>
of a corresponding shape; 2nd, if the tube close at the upper part of<br>
the testicle, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, thus
isolating the tunica vaginalis, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>,
while the<br>
upper part, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, remains
pervious, and the internal ring, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">a,</span>
open, and<br>
communicating with the peritonaeal sac, a hydrocele of the cord will<br>
happen distinct from the tunica vaginalis; or this latter may be, at the<br>
same time, distended with fluid, if the disposition of the subject be<br>
favourable to the formation of dropsy; 3rd, the serous tube may close at<br>
the internal ring, form sacculi along the cord, and close again at the<br>
top of the testicle, thus separating the tunica vaginalis from the<br>
abdomen, and thereby several isolated hydroceles may be formed. If in<br>
this condition of the parts we puncture one of the sacs for the<br>
evacuation of its contents, the others, owing to their separation, will<br>
remain distended.<br>

Plate 40--Figure 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 40, Fig. 3.--<span style="font-style: italic;">Hydrocele of the
isolated tunica vaginalis</span>.--When the<br>
serous spermatic tube, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, 6
<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, becomes obliterated,
according to the<br>
normal rule, after the descent of the testicle, 7, the tunica vaginalis,<br>
6 <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, is then a distinct
serous sac. If a hydrocele form in this sac, it<br>
may be distinguished from the congenital variety by its remaining<br>
undiminished in bulk when the subject assumes the horizontal position,<br>
or when pressure is made on the tumour, for its contents cannot now be<br>
forced into the abdomen. The testicle, 7, holds the same position in<br>
this as it does in the congenital hydrocele. [Footnote] The radical cure<br>
may be performed here without endangering the peritonaeal sac.<br>
Congenital hydrocele is of a cylindrical shape; and this is mentioned as<br>
distinguishing it from isolated hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, which<br>
is pyriform; but this mark will fail when the cord is at the same time<br>
distended, as it may be, in the latter form of the complaint.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: When a hydrocele is interposed between the eye and a strong<br>
light, the testis appears as an opaque body at the back of the tunica<br>
vaginalis. But this position of the organ is, from several causes,<br>
liable to vary. The testis may have become morbidly adherent to the<br>
front wall of the serous sac, in which case the hydrocele will distend<br>
the sac laterally. Or the testis may be so transposed in the scrotum,<br>
that, whilst the gland occupies its front part, the distended tunica<br>
vaginalis is turned behind. The tunica vaginalis, like the serous<br>
spermatic tube, may, in consequence of inflammatory fibrinous effusion,<br>
become sacculated-multilocular, in which case, if a hydrocele form, the<br>
position of the testis will vary accordingly.--See Sir Astley Cooper's<br>
work, ("Anatomy and Diseases of the Testis;") Morton's "Surgical<br>
Anatomy;" Mr. Curling's "Treatise on Diseases of the Testis;" and also<br>
his article "Testicle," in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology.]<br>

PLATE 40, Fig. 4.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The serous
spermatic tube remaining pervious, a</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">congenital hernia is formed.</span>--When
the testicle, 7, has descended to the<br>
scrotum, if the communication between the peritonaeum, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, and the<br>
tunica vaginalis, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, be not
obliterated, a fold of the intestine, 13,<br>
will follow the testicle, and occupy the cavity of the tunica vaginalis,<br>
6 <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>. In this form of hernia
(hernia tunicae vaginalis, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cooper</span>),
the<br>
intestine is in front of, and in immediate contact with, the testicle.<br>
The intestine may descend lower than the testicle, and envelope this<br>
organ so completely as to render its position very obscure to the touch.<br>
This form of hernia is named congenital, since it occurs in the same<br>
condition of the parts as is found in congenital hydrocele--viz., the<br>
inguinal ring remaining unclosed. It may occur at any period of life, so<br>
long as the original congenital defect remains. It may be distinguished<br>
from hydrocele by its want of transparency and fluctuation. The impulse<br>
which is communicated to the hand applied to the scrotum of a person<br>
affected with scrotal hernia, when he is made to cough, is also felt in<br>
the case of congenital hydrocele. But in hydrocele of the separate<br>
tunica vaginalis, such impulse is not perceived. Congenital hernia and<br>
hydrocele may co-exist; and, in this case, the diagnostic signs which<br>
are proper to each, when occurring separately, will be so mingled as to<br>
render the precise nature of the case obscure.<br>

Plate 40--Figure 4.<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 40, Fig. 5.--<span style="font-style: italic;">Infantile hernia.</span>--When
the serous spermatic tube<br>
becomes merely closed, or obliterated at the inguinal ring, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, the<br>
lower part of it, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">c,</span> is
pervious, and communicating with the tunica<br>
vaginalis, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>. In
consequence of the closure of the tube at the<br>
inguinal ring, if a hernia now occur, it cannot enter the tunica<br>
vaginalis, and come into actual contact with the testicle. The hernia,<br>
13, therefore, when about to force the peritonaeum, 6<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> a</span>, near the closed<br>
ring, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, takes a distinct
sac or investment from this membrane. This<br>
hernial sac, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>, will vary
as to its position in regard to the tunica<br>
vaginalis, 6 <span style="font-weight: bold;">d</span>, according to
the place whereat it dilates the<br>
peritonaeum at the ring. The peculiarity of this hernia, as<br>
distinguished from the congenital form, is owing to the scrotum<br>
containing two sacs,--the tunica vaginalis and the proper sac of the<br>
hernia; whereas, in the congenital variety, the tunica vaginalis itself<br>
becomes the hernial sac by a direct reception of the naked intestine. If<br>
in infantile hernia a hydrocele should form in the tunica vaginalis, the<br>
fluid will also distend the pervious serous spermatic tube, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, as far<br>
up as the closed internal ring, 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>,
and will thus invest and obscure<br>
the descending herniary sac, 13. This form of hernia is named infantile<br>
(<span style="font-style: italic;">Hey</span>), owing to the congenital
defect in that process, whereby the<br>
serous tube lining the cord is normally obliterated. Such a form of<br>
hernia may occur at the adult age for the first time, but it is still<br>
the consequence of original default.<br>

<br>
<br>
PLATE 40, Fig. 6.--<span style="font-style: italic;">Oblique inguinal
hernia in the adult.</span>--This variety<br>
of hernia occurs not in consequence of any congenital defect, except<br>
inasmuch as the natural weakness of the inguinal wall opposite the<br>
internal ring may be attributed to this cause. The serous spermatic tube<br>
has been normally obliterated for its whole length between the internal<br>
ring and the tunica vaginalis; but the fibrous tube, or spermatic<br>
fascia, is open at the internal ring where it joins the transversalis<br>
fascia, and remains pervious as far down as the testicle. The intestine,<br>
13, forces and distends the upper end of the closed serous tube; and as<br>
this is now wholly obliterated, the herniary sac, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, derived anew from<br>
the inguinal peritonaeum, enters the fibrous tube, or sheath of the<br>
cord, and descends it as far as the tunica vaginalis, 6 <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, but does not<br>
enter this sac, as it is already closed. When we compare this hernia,<br>
Fig. 6, Plate 40, with the infantile variety, Fig. 5, Plate 40, we find<br>
that they agree in so far as the intestinal sac is distinct from the<br>
tunica vaginalis; whereas the difference between them is caused by the<br>
fact of the serous cord remaining in part pervious in the infantile<br>
hernia; and on comparing Fig. 6, Plate 40, with the congenital variety,<br>
Fig. 4, Plate 40, we see that the intestine has acquired a new sac in<br>
the former, whereas, in the latter, the intestine has entered the tunica<br>
vaginalis. The variable position of the testicle in Figs. 4, 5, &amp; 6,<br>
Plate 40, is owing to the variety in the anatomical circumstances under<br>
which these herniae have happened.<br>
