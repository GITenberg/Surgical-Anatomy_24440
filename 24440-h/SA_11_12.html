<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE AXILLARY AND BRACHIAL REGIONS,<br>
DISPLAYING THE RELATIVE ORDER OF THEIR CONTAINED PARTS.<br>
<br>
All surgical regions have only artificial boundaries; and these, as<br>
might be expected, do not express the same meaning while viewed from<br>
more points than one. These very boundaries themselves, being moveable<br>
parts, must accordingly influence the relative position of the<br>
structures which they bound, and thus either include within or exclude<br>
from the particular region those structures wholly or in part which are<br>
said to be proper to it. Of this kind of conventional surgical boundary<br>
the moveable clavicle is an example; and the bloodvessels which it<br>
overarches manifest consequently neither termination nor origin except<br>
artificially from the fixed position which the bone, R, assumes, as in<br>
Plate 11, or <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>*, Plate 12. In
this position of the arm in relation to<br>
the trunk, the subclavian artery, B, terminates at the point where,<br>
properly speaking, it first takes its name; and from this point to the<br>
posterior fold of the axilla formed by the latissimus dorsi muscle, O,<br>
Plate 11, N, Plate 12, and the anterior fold formed by the great<br>
pectoral muscle, K, Plate 11, I, Plate 12, the continuation of the<br>
subclavian artery is named axillary. From the posterior fold of the<br>
axilla, O P, Plate 11, to the bend of the elbow, the same main vessels<br>
take the name of brachial.<br>
<br>
When the axillary space is cut into from the forepart through the great<br>
pectoral muscle, H K, Plate 11, and beneath this through the lesser<br>
pectoral muscle, L I, together with the fascial processes which invest<br>
these muscles anteriorly and posteriorly, the main bloodvessels and<br>
nerves which traverse this space are displayed, holding in general that<br>
relative position which they exhibit in Plate 11. These vessels, with<br>
their accompanying nerves, will be seen continued from those of the<br>
neck; and thus may be attained in one view a comparative estimate of the<br>
cervical and axillary regions, together with their line of union beneath<br>
the clavicle, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>*, Plate 12,
R, Plate 11, which serves to divide them<br>
surgically.<br>
<br>
In the neck, the subclavian artery, B, Plate 11, is seen to be separated<br>
from the subclavian vein, A, by the breadth of the anterior scalenus<br>
muscle, D, as the vessels arch over the first rib, F. In this region of<br>
the course of the vessels, the brachial plexus of nerves, C, ranges<br>
along the outer border of the artery, B, and is separated by the artery<br>
from the vein, A, as all three structures pass beneath the clavicle, R,<br>
and the subclavius muscle, E. From this latter point the vessels and<br>
nerves take the name axillary, and in this axillary region the relative<br>
position of the nerves and vessels to each other and to the adjacent<br>
organs is somewhat changed. For now in the axillary region the vein, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,<br>
is in direct contact with the artery, <span style="font-style: italic;">b,</span>
on the forepart and somewhat to<br>
the inner side of which the vein lies; while the nerves, D, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d,</span> Plate 12,<br>
embrace the artery in a mesh or plexus of chords, from which it is often<br>
difficult to extricate it, for the purpose of ligaturing, in the dead<br>
subject, much less the living. The axillary plexus of nerves well merits<br>
the name, for I have not found it in any two bodies assuming a similar<br>
order or arrangement. Perhaps the order in which branches spring from<br>
the brachial plexus that is most constantly met with is the one<br>
represented at D, Plate 12, where we find, on the outer border of B, the<br>
axillary artery, a nervous chord, <span style="font-style: italic;">d,</span>
giving off a thoracic branch to<br>
pass behind H, the lesser pectoral muscle, while the main chord itself,<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, soon divides into two
branches, one the musculo-cutaneous, <span style="font-style: italic;">e,</span>
which<br>
pierces G, the coraco-brachialis muscle, and the other which forms one<br>
of the roots of the median nerve, <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>.
Following that order of the nerves<br>
as they are shown in Plate 12, they may be enumerated from without<br>
inwards as follows:--the external or musculo-cutaneous, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">e</span>; the two roots<br>
of the median, <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>;&nbsp; the
ulnar, <span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>; the musculo-spiral,
<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>; the
circumflex,<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>; close to which are seen the
origins of the internal cutaneous, the<br>
nerve of Wrisberg, some thoracic branches, and posteriorly the<br>
subscapular nerve not seen in this view of the parts.<br>
<br>
The branches which come off from the axillary artery are very variable<br>
both as to number and place of origin, but in general will be found<br>
certain branches which answer to the names thoracic, subscapular, and<br>
circumflex. These vessels, together with numerous smaller arteries,<br>
appear to be confined to no fixed point of origin, and on this account<br>
the place of election for passing a ligature around the main axillary<br>
artery sufficiently removed from collateral branches must be always<br>
doubtful. The subscapular artery, Q, Plate 12, is perhaps of all the<br>
other branches that one which manifests the most permanent character;<br>
its point of origin being in general opposite the interval between the<br>
latissimus and sub-scapular muscles, but I have seen it arise from all<br>
parts of the axillary main trunk. If it be required to give, in a<br>
history of the arteries, a full account of all the deviations from the<br>
so-called normal type to which these lesser branches here and elsewhere<br>
are subject, such account can scarcely be said to be called for in this<br>
place.<br>
<br>
The form of the axillary space is conical, while the arm is abducted<br>
from the side, and while the osseous and muscular structures remain<br>
entire. The apex of the cone is formed at the root of the neck beneath<br>
the clavicle, R, Plate 11, and the subclavious muscle, E, and between<br>
the coracoid process, L*, of the scapula and the serratus magnus muscle,<br>
as this lies upon the thoracic side; at this apex the subclavian<br>
vessels, A B, enter the axillary space. The base of the cone is below,<br>
looking towards the arm, and is formed in front by the pectoralis major,<br>
K H, and behind by the latissimus dorsi, O, and teres muscles, P,<br>
together with a dense thick fascia; at this base the axillary vessels, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, pass out to the arm, and
become the brachial vessels, <span style="font-style: italic;">a*b*</span>.
The<br>
anterior side of the cone is formed by the great pectoral muscle, H K,<br>
Plate 11, and the lesser pectoral, L I. The inner side is formed by the<br>
serratus magnus muscle, M, Plate 12, on the side of the thorax; the<br>
external side is formed by the scapular and humeral insertion of the<br>
subscapular muscle, the humerus and coraco-brachialis muscle; and the<br>
posterior side is formed by the latissimus dorsi, the teres and body of<br>
the subscapular muscle.<br>
<br>
In this axillary region is contained a complicated mass of bloodvessels,<br>
nerves, and lymphatic glands, surrounded by a large quantity of loose<br>
cellular membrane and adipose tissue. All the arterial branches here<br>
found are given off from the axillary artery; and the numerous veins<br>
which accompany these branches enter the axillary vein. Nerves from<br>
other sources besides those of the axillary plexus traverse the axillary<br>
space; such nerves, for example, as those named intercosto-humeral, seen<br>
lying on the latissimus tendon, O, Plate 11. The vein named cephalic, S,<br>
enters the axillary space at that cellular interval occurring between<br>
the clavicular origin of the deltoid muscle, G, and the humeral<br>
attachment of the pectoralis major, H, which interval marks the place of<br>
incision for tying the axillary artery.<br>
<br>
The general course of the main vessels through the axillary space would<br>
be indicated with sufficient accuracy by a line drawn from the middle of<br>
the clavicle, R R, Plate 11, to the inner border of the biceps muscle,<br>
N. In this direction of the axillary vessels, the coracoid process, L*,<br>
from which arises the tendon of the pectoralis minor muscle, L, is to be<br>
taken as a sure guide to the place of the artery, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, which passes, in<br>
general, close to the inner side of this bony process. Even in the<br>
undissected body the coracoid process may be felt as a fixed resisting<br>
point at that cellular interval between the clavicular attachments of<br>
the deltoid and great pectoral muscles. Whatever necessity shall require<br>
a ligature to be placed around the axillary in preference to the<br>
subclavian artery, must, of course, be determined by the particular<br>
case; but certain it is that the main artery, at the place B, a little<br>
above the clavicle, will always be found freer and more isolated from<br>
its accompanying nerves and vein, and also more easily reached, owing to<br>
its comparatively superficial situation, than when this vessel has<br>
become axillary. The incision required to be made, in order to reach the<br>
axillary artery, <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, from the
forepart, through the skin, both pectoral<br>
muscles, and different layers of fasciae, must be very deep, especially<br>
in muscular, well-conditioned bodies; and even when the level of the<br>
vessel is gained, it will be found much complicated by its own branches,<br>
some of which overlie it, as also by the plexus of nerves, D, Plate 12,<br>
which embraces it on all sides, while the large axillary vein, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, Plate<br>
11, nearly conceals it in front. This vein in Plate 11 is drawn somewhat<br>
apart from the artery.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the axillary artery is double, in consequence of its high<br>
division into brachial branches. But as this peculiarity of premature<br>
division never takes place so high up as where the vessel, B, Plate 11,<br>
overarches the first rib, F, this circumstance should also have some<br>
weight with the operator.<br>
<br>
When we view the relative position of the subclavian vessels, A B, Plate<br>
11, to the clavicle, R, we can readily understand why a fracture of the<br>
middle of this bone through that arch which it forms over the vessels,<br>
should interfere with the free circulation of the blood which these<br>
vessels supply to the arm. When the clavicle is severed at its middle,<br>
the natural arch which the bone forms over the vessels and nerves is<br>
lost, and the free moving broken ends of the bone will be acted on in<br>
opposing directions by the various muscles attached to its sternal and<br>
scapular extremities. The outer fragment follows more freely than the<br>
inner piece the action of the muscles; but, most of all, the weight of<br>
the unsupported shoulder and arm causes the displacement to which the<br>
outer fragment is liable. The subclavius muscle, E, like the pronator<br>
quadratus muscle of the forearm, serves rather to further the<br>
displacement of the broken ends of the bone than to hold them in situ.<br>
<br>
If the head of the humerus be dislocated forwards beneath L, Plate 11,<br>
the coracoid attachment of the pectoralis minor muscle, it must press<br>
out of their proper place and put tensely upon the stretch the axillary<br>
vessels and plexus of nerves. So large and resistent a body as the head<br>
of the humerus displaced forwards, and taking the natural position of<br>
these vessels and nerves, will accordingly be attended with other<br>
symptoms--such as obstructed circulation and pain or partial paralysis,<br>
besides those physical signs by which we distinguish the presence of it<br>
as a new body in its abnormal situation.<br>
<br>
When the main vessels and nerves pass from the axillary space to the<br>
inner side of the arm, they become comparatively superficial in this<br>
latter situation. The inner border of the biceps muscle is taken as a<br>
guide to the place of the brachial artery for the whole extent of its<br>
course in the arm. In plate 11, the artery, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b*</span>, is seen in company with<br>
the median nerve, which lies on its fore part, and with the veins called<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">comites</span> winding round it and
passing with it and the nerve beneath the<br>
fascia which encases in a fold of itself all three structures in a<br>
common sheath. Though the axillary vein is in close contact with the<br>
axillary artery and nerves, yet the basilic vein, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>*, the most<br>
considerable of those vessels which form the axillary vein, is separated<br>
from the brachial artery by the fascia. The basilic vein, however,<br>
overlies the brachial artery to its inner side, and is most commonly<br>
attended by the internal cutaneous nerve, seen lying upon it in Plate<br>
11, as also by that other cutaneous branch of the brachial plexus, named<br>
the nerve of Wrisberg. If a longitudinal incision in the course of the<br>
brachial artery be made (avoiding the basilic vein) through the<br>
integument down to the fascia of the arm, and the latter structure be<br>
slit open on the director, the artery will be exposed, having the median<br>
nerve lying on its outer side in the upper third of the arm, and passing<br>
to its inner side towards the bend of the elbow, as at <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>*, Plate 12. The<br>
superior and inferior profunda arteries, seen springing above and below<br>
the point <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, Plate 12, are
those vessels of most importance which are<br>
given off from the brachial artery, but the situation of their origin is<br>
very various. The ulnar nerve, <span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>,
lies close to the inner side of the<br>
main arterial trunk, as this latter leaves the axilla, but from this<br>
place to the inner condyle, Q, behind which the ulnar nerve passes into<br>
the forearm, the nerve and artery become gradually more and more<br>
separated from each other in their descent. The musculo-spiral nerve, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g,</span><br>
winds under the brachial artery at the middle of the arm, but as this<br>
nerve passes deep between the short and long heads of the triceps<br>
muscle, P, and behind the humerus to gain the outer aspect of the limb,<br>
a little care will suffice for avoiding the inclusion of it in the<br>
ligature.<br>
<br>
The brachial artery may be so effectually compressed by the fingers on<br>
the tourniquet, against the humerus in any part of its course through<br>
the arm, as to stop pulsation at the wrist.<br>
<br>
The tourniquet is a less manageable and not more certain compressor of<br>
the arterial trunk than is the hand of an intelligent assistant. At<br>
every region of the course of an artery where the tourniquet is<br>
applicable, a sufficient compression by the hand is also attainable with<br>
greater ease to the patient; and the hand may compress the vessel at<br>
certain regions where the tourniquet would be of little or no use, or<br>
attended with inconvenience, as in the locality of the subclavian<br>
artery, passing over the first rib, or the femoral artery, passing over<br>
the pubic bone, or the carotid vessels in the neighbourhood of the<br>
trachea, as they lie on the fore part of the cervical spinal column.<br>
