COMMENTARY&nbsp; ON PLATES 20 &amp; 21.<br>
<br>
THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE CRANIAL,<br>
NASAL, ORAL, AND PHARYNGEAL CAVITIES, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
On making a section (vertically through the median line) of the<br>
cranio-facial and cervico-hyoid apparatus, the relation which these<br>
structures bear to each other in the osseous skeleton reminds me<br>
strongly of the great fact enunciated by the philosophical anatomists,<br>
that the facial apparatus manifests in reference to the cranial<br>
structures the same general relations which the hyoid apparatus bears to<br>
the cervical vertebrae, and that these relations are similar to those<br>
which the thoracic apparatus bears to the dorsal vertebrae. To this<br>
anatomical fact I shall not make any further allusions, except in so far<br>
as the acknowledgment of it shall serve to illustrate some points of<br>
surgical import.<br>
<br>
The cranial chamber, A A H, Plate 20, is continuous with the spinal<br>
canal C. The osseous envelope of the brain, called calvarium, Z B, holds<br>
serial order with the cervical spinous processes, E I, and these with<br>
the dorsal spinous processes. The dura-matral lining membrane, A A A*,<br>
of the cranial chamber is continuous with the lining membrane, C, of the<br>
spinal canal. The brain is continuous with the spinal cord. The<br>
intervertebral foramina of the cervical spine are manifesting serial<br>
order with the cranial foramina. The nerves which pass through the<br>
spinal region of this series of foramina above and below C are<br>
continuous with the nerves which pass through the cranial region. The<br>
anterior boundary, D I, of the cervical spine is continuous with the<br>
anterior boundary, Y F, of the cranial cavity. And this common serial<br>
order of osseous parts--viz., the bodies of vertebrae, serves to<br>
isolate the cranio-spinal compartment from the facial and cervical<br>
passages. Thus the anterior boundary, Y F D I, of the cranio-spinal<br>
canal is also the posterior boundary of the facial and cervical<br>
cavities.<br>
<br>
Now as the cranio-spinal chamber is lined by the common dura-matral<br>
membrane, and contains the common mass of nervous structure, thus<br>
inviting us to fix attention upon this structure as a whole, so we find<br>
that the frontal cavity, Z, the nasal cavity, X W, the oral cavity, 4,<br>
5, S, the pharyngeal and oesophageal passages 8 Q, are lined by the<br>
common mucous membrane, and communicate so freely with each other that<br>
they may be in fact considered as forming a common cavity divided only<br>
by partially formed septa, such as the one, U V, which separates to some<br>
extent the nasal fossa from the oral fossa.<br>
<br>
As owing to this continuity of structure, visible between the head and<br>
spine, we may infer the liability which the affections of the one region<br>
have to pass into and implicate the other, so likewise by that<br>
continuity apparent between all compartments of the face, fauces,<br>
oesophagus, and larynx, we may estimate how the pathological condition<br>
of the one region will concern the others.<br>
<br>
The cranium, owing to its comparatively superficial and undefended<br>
condition, is liable to fracture. When the cranium is fractured, in<br>
consequence of force applied to its anterior or posterior surfaces, A or<br>
B, Plate 20, the fracture will, for the most part, be confined to the<br>
place whereat the force has been applied, provided the point opposite<br>
has not been driven against some resisting body at the same time. Thus<br>
when the point B is struck by a force sufficient to fracture the bone,<br>
while the point A is not opposed to any resisting body, then B alone<br>
will yield to the force applied; and fracture thus occurring at the<br>
point B, will have happened at the place where the applied force is met<br>
by the force, or weight, or inertia of the head itself. But when B is<br>
struck by any ponderous body, while A is at the same moment forced<br>
against a resisting body, then A is also liable to suffer fracture. If<br>
fracture in one place be attended with counter-fracture in another<br>
place, as at the opposite points A and B, then the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">fracture</span> occurs from<br>
the force impelling, while the <span style="font-style: italic;">counter-fracture</span>
happens by the force<br>
resisting.<br>
<br>
Now in the various motions which the cranium A A B performs upon the top<br>
of the cervical spine C, motions backwards, forwards, and to either<br>
side, it will follow that, taking C as a fixed point, almost all parts<br>
of the cranial periphery will be brought vertical to C in succession,<br>
and therefore whichever point happens at the moment to stand opposite to<br>
C, and has impelling force applied to it, then C becomes the point of<br>
resistance, and thus counter-fractures at the cranial base occur in the<br>
neighbourhood of C. When force is applied to the cranial vertex, whilst<br>
the body is in the erect posture, the top of the cervical spine, E D C,<br>
becomes the point of resistance. Or if the body fall from a height upon<br>
its cranial vertex, then the propelling force will take effect at the<br>
junction of the spine with the cranial base, whilst the resisting force<br>
will be the ground upon which the vertex strikes. In either case the<br>
cranial base, as well as the vertex, will be liable to fracture.<br>
<br>
The anatomical form of the cranium is such as to obviate a frequent<br>
liability to fracture. Its rounded shape diffuses, as is the case with<br>
all rotund forms, the force which happens to strike upon it. The mode in<br>
which the cranium is set upon the cervical spine serves also to diffuse<br>
the pressure at the points where the two opposing forces meet--viz., at<br>
the first cervical vertebra E and the cranial basilar process F. This<br>
fact might be proved upon mechanical principle.<br>
<br>
The tegumentary envelope of the head, as well as the dura-matral lining,<br>
serves to damp cranial vibration consequent upon concussion; while the<br>
sutural isolation of the several component bones of the cranium also<br>
prevents, in some degree, the extension of fractures and the vibrations<br>
of concussion. The contents of the head, like the contents of all hollow<br>
forms, receive the vibratory influence of force externally applied. The<br>
brain receives the concussion of the force applied to its osseous<br>
envelope; and when this latter happens to be fractured, the danger to<br>
life is not in proportion to the extent of the fracture here, any more<br>
than elsewhere in the skeleton fabric, but is solely in proportion to<br>
the amount of shock or injury sustained by the nervous centre.<br>
<br>
When it is required to trephine any part of the cranial envelope, the<br>
points which should be avoided, as being in the neighbourhood of<br>
important bloodvessels, are the following--the occipital protuberance,<br>
B, within which the "torcular Herophili" is situated, and from this<br>
point passing through the median line of the vertex forwards to Z the<br>
frontal sinus, the trephine should not be applied, as this line marks<br>
the locality of the superior longitudinal sinus. The great lateral sinus<br>
is marked by the superior occipital ridge passing from the point B<br>
outwards to the mastoid process. The central point B of the side of the<br>
head, Plate 21, marks the locality of the root of the meningeal artery<br>
within the cranium, and from this point the vessel branches forwards and<br>
backwards over the interior of the cranium.<br>
<br>
The nasal fossae are situated on either side of the median partition<br>
formed by the vomer and cartilaginous nasal septum. Both nasal fossae<br>
are open anteriorly and posteriorly; but laterally they do not, in the<br>
normal state of these parts, communicate. The two posterior nares<br>
answering to the two nasal fossae open into the upper part of the bag of<br>
the pharynx at 8, Plate 20, which marks the opening of the Eustachian<br>
tube.<br>
<br>
The structures observable in both the nasal fossae absolutely<br>
correspond, and the foramina which open into each correspond likewise.<br>
All structures situated on either side of the median line are similar.<br>
And the structure which occupies the median line is itself double, or<br>
duality fused into symmetrical unity. The osseous nasal septum is<br>
composed of two laminae laid side by side. The spongy bones, X W, are<br>
attached to the outer wall of the nasal fossa, and are situated one<br>
above the other. These bones are three in number, the uppermost is the<br>
smallest. The outer wall of each naris is grooved by three fossae,<br>
called meatuses, and these are situated between the spongy bones. Each<br>
meatus receives one or more openings of various canals and cavities of<br>
the facial apparatus. The sphenoidal sinus near F opens into the upper<br>
meatus. The frontal, Z, and maxillary sinuses open into the middle<br>
meatus, and the nasal duct opens into the inferior sinus beneath the<br>
anterior inferior angle of the lower spongy bone, W.<br>
<br>
In the living body the very vascular fleshy and glandular Schneiderian<br>
membrane which lines all parts of the nasal fossa almost completely<br>
fills this cavity. When polypi or other growths occupy the nasal fossae,<br>
they must gain room at the expense of neighbouring parts. The nasal duct<br>
may have a bent probe introduced into it by passing the instrument along<br>
the outer side of the floor of the nasal fossa as far back as the<br>
anterior inferior angle of the lower spongy bone, W, at which locality<br>
the duct opens. An instrument of sufficient length, when introduced into<br>
the nostrils in the same direction, will, if passed backwards through<br>
the posterior nares, reach the opening of the Eustachian tube, 8.<br>
<br>
While the jaws are closed, the tongue, R, Plate 20, occupies the oral<br>
cavity almost completely. When the jaws are opened they form a cavity<br>
between them equal in capacity to the degree at which they are sundered<br>
from each other. The back of the pharynx can be seen when the jaws are<br>
widely opened if the tongue be depressed, as R, Plate 20. The hard<br>
palate, U, which forms the roof of the mouth, is extended further<br>
backwards by the soft palate, V, which hangs as the loose velum of the<br>
throat between the nasal fossae above and the fauces below. Between the<br>
velum palati, V, and the root of the tongue, we may readily discern,<br>
when the jaws are open, two ridges of arching form, 5, 6, on either side<br>
of the fauces. These prominent arches and their fellows are named the<br>
pillars of the fauces. The anterior pillar, 5, is formed by the<br>
submucous palato-glossus muscle; the posterior pillar, 6, is formed by<br>
the palato-pharyngeus muscle. Between these pillars, 5 and 6, is<br>
situated the tonsil, S, beneath the mucous membrane. When the tonsils of<br>
opposite sides become inflamed and suppurate, an incision may be made<br>
into either gland without much chance of wounding the internal carotid<br>
artery; for, in fact, this vessel lies somewhat removed from it behind.<br>
In Plate 21, that point of the superior constrictor of the pharynx,<br>
marked D, indicates the situation of the tonsil gland; and a<br>
considerable interval will be seen to exist between D and the internal<br>
carotid vessel F.<br>
<br>
If the head be thrown backwards the nasal and oral cavities will look<br>
almost vertically towards the pharyngeal pouch. When the juggler is<br>
about to "swallow the sword," he throws the head back so as to bring the<br>
mouth and fauces in a straight line with the pharynx and oesophagus. And<br>
when the surgeon passes the probang or other instruments into the<br>
oesophagus, he finds it necessary to give the head of the person on whom<br>
he operates the same inclination backwards. When instruments are being<br>
passed into the oesophagus through the nasal fossa, they are not so<br>
likely to encounter the rima glottidis below the epiglottis, 9, as when<br>
they are being passed into the oesophagus by the mouth. The glottis may<br>
be always avoided by keeping the point of the instrument pressing<br>
against the back of the pharynx during its passage downwards.<br>
<br>
When in suspended animation we endeavour to inflate the lungs through<br>
the nose or mouth, we should press the larynx, 10, 11,12, backwards<br>
against the vertebral column, so as to close the oesophageal tube.<br>
