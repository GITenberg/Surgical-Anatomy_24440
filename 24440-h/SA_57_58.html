<br>
CONGENITAL AND PATHOLOGICAL DEFORMITIES OF THE PREPUCE AND<br>
URETHRA.--STRICTURE AND MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTIONS OF THE URETHRA.<br>
<br>
<br>
When any of the central organs of the body presents in a form differing<br>
from that which we term natural, or structurally perfect and efficient,<br>
if the deformity be one which results as a malformation, ascribable to<br>
an error in the law of development, it is always characterized as an<br>
excess or defect of the substance of the organ at, and in reference to,<br>
the median line. And when any of the canals which naturally open upon<br>
the external surface at the median line happens to deviate from its<br>
proper position, such deviation, if it be the result of an error in the<br>
law of development, always occurs, by an actual necessity, at the median<br>
line. On the contrary, though deformities which are the results of<br>
diseased action in a central organ may and do, in some instances,<br>
simulate those which occur by an error in the process of development,<br>
the former cannot bear a like interpretation with the latter, for those<br>
are the effects of ever-varying circumstances, whereas these are the<br>
effects of certain deviations in a natural process--a law, whose course<br>
is serial, gradational, and in the sequent order of a continuous chain<br>
of cause and effect.<br>
<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 57, represents the prepuce in a state of congenital<br>
phymosis. The part hypertrophied and pendent projects nearly an inch in<br>
front of the meatus, and forms a canal, continued forwards from this<br>
orifice. As the prepuce in such a state becomes devoid of its proper<br>
function, and hence must be regarded, not only as a mere superfluity,<br>
but as a cause of impediment to the generative function of the whole<br>
organ, it should be removed by an operation.<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 57, represents the prepuce in the condition of<br>
paraphymosis following gonorrhoeal inflammation. The part appears<br>
constricting the penis and urethra behind the corona glandis. This state<br>
of the organ is produced in the following-mentioned way:--the prepuce,<br>
naturally very extensible, becomes, while covering the glans, inflamed,<br>
thickened, and its orifice contracted. It is during this state withdrawn<br>
forcibly backwards over the glans, and in this situation, while being<br>
itself the first cause of constriction, it induces another--namely, an<br>
arrest to the venous circulation, which is followed by a turgescence of<br>
the glans. In the treatment of such a case, the indication is, first, to<br>
reduce by gradual pressure the size of the glans, so that the prepuce<br>
may be replaced over it; secondly, to lessen the inflammation by the<br>
ordinary means.<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 3, Plate 57, exhibits the form of a gonorrhoeal phymosis. The<br>
orifice of the prepuce is contracted, and the tissue of it infiltrated.<br>
If in this state of the part, consequent upon diseased action, or in<br>
that of Fig. 1, which is congenital, the foreskin be retracted over the<br>
glans, a paraphymosis, like Fig. 2, will be produced.<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 4, Plate 57, shows a form of phymosis in which the prepuce during<br>
inflammation has become adherent to the whole surface of the glans. The<br>
orifice of the prepuce being directly opposite the meatus, and the parts<br>
offering no obstruction to the flow of urine, an operation for<br>
separating the prepuce from the glans would not be required.<br>
<br>

<br>
Fig. 5, Plate 57.--In this figure is represented the form of the penis<br>
of an adult, in whom the prepuce was removed by circumcision at an early<br>
age. The membrane covering the glans and the part which is cicatrised<br>
becomes in these cases dry, indurated, and deprived of its special
sense.<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 6, Plate 57.--In this figure the glans appears protruding through<br>
the upper surface of the prepuce, which is thickened and corrugated.<br>
This state of the parts was caused by a venereal ulceration of the upper<br>
part of the prepuce, sufficient to allow the glans to press through the<br>
aperture. The prepuce in this condition being superfluous, and acting as<br>
an impediment, should be removed by operation.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Fig. 7, Plate 57.--In this figure is shown a condition of the glans and<br>
prepuce resembling that last mentioned, and the effect of a similar<br>
cause. By the removal of the prepuce when in the position here<br>
represented, or in that of Fig. 6, the organ may be made to assume the<br>
appearance of Fig. 5.<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 7.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 8, Plate 57, represents the form of a congenital hypospadias. The<br>
corpus spongiosum does not continue the canal of the urethra as far<br>
forwards as the usual position of the meatus, but has become defective<br>
behind the fraenum praeputii, leaving the canal open at this place. In a<br>
case of this kind an operation on the taliacotian principle might be<br>
tried in order to close the urethra where it presents abnormally patent.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 8.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 9, Plate 57, represents a congenital hypospadias, in which the<br>
canal of the urethra opens by two distinct apertures along the under<br>
surface of the corpus spongiosum at the middle line. A probe traverses<br>
both apertures. In such a case, if the canal of the urethra were<br>
perforate as far forwards as the meatus, and this latter in its normal<br>
position, the two false openings should be closed by an operation.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 9.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 10, Plate 57.--The urethra is here represented as having a false<br>
opening on its under surface behind the fraenum. The perforation was<br>
caused by a venereal ulcer. The meatus and urethra anterior to the false<br>
aperture remained perforate. Part of a bougie appears traversing the<br>
false opening and the meatus. In this state of the organ an attempt<br>
should be made to close the false aperture permanently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="images/128P57F10_25.jpg"><img alt=""

Plate 57.--Figure 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 11, Plate 57, shows a state of the urethra similar to that of Fig.<br>
10, and the effect of the same cause. Part of a bougie is seen<br>
traversing the false aperture from the meatus before to the urethra<br>
behind. In this case, as the whole substance of the corpus spongiosum<br>
was destroyed for half an inch in extent, the taliacotian operation, by<br>
which lost quantity is supplied, is the measure most likely to succeed<br>
in closing the canal.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Fig. 12, Plate 57.--Behind the meatus, and on the right of the fraenum,<br>
is represented a perforation in the urethra, caused by a venereal ulcer.<br>
The meatus and the false opening have approached by the contraction of<br>
the cicatrix; in consequence of which, also, the apex of the glans is<br>
distorted towards the urethra; a bougie introduced by the meatus<br>
occupies the urethral canal.<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 12.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 13, Plate 57.--In this figure the canal of the urethra appears<br>
turning upwards and opening at the median line behind the corona<br>
glandis. This state of the urethra was caused by a venereal ulcer<br>
penetrating the canal from the dorsum of the penis. The proper direction<br>
of the canal might be restored by obliterating the false passage,<br>
provided the urethra remained perforate in the direction of the meatus.<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 13.<br>
<br>
Fig. 14, Plate 57, exhibits the form of a congenital epispadias, in<br>
which the urethra is seen to open on the dorsal surface of the prepuce<br>
at the median line. The glans appears cleft and deformed. The meatus is<br>
deficient at its usual place. The prepuce at the dorsum is in part<br>
deficient, and bound to the glans around the abnormal orifice.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 15, Plate 57, represents in section a state of the parts in which<br>
the urethra opened externally by one fistulous aperture, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a, </span>behind the<br>
scrotum; and by another, <span style="font-style: italic;">b,</span>
in front of the scrotum. At the latter place<br>
the canal beneath the penis became imperforate for an inch in extent.<br>
Parts of catheters are seen to enter the urethra through the fistulous<br>
openings<span style="font-style: italic;"> a b;</span> and another
instrument, <span style="font-style: italic;">c,</span> is seen to
pass by the proper<br>
meatus into the urethra as far as the point where this portion of the<br>
canal fails to communicate with the other. The under part of the scrotum<br>
presents a cleft corresponding with the situation of the scrotal septum.<br>
This state of the urinary passage may be the effect either of congenital<br>
deficiency or of disease. When caused by disease, the chief features in<br>
its history, taking these in the order of their occurrence, are, 1st, a<br>
stricture in the anterior part of the urethra; 2ndly, a rupture of this<br>
canal behind the stricture; 3rdly, the formation (on an abscess opening<br>
externally) of a fistulous communication between the canal and the<br>
surface of some part of the perinaeum; 4thly, the habitual escape of the<br>
urine by the false aperture;&nbsp; 5thly, the obliteration of the canal
to a<br>
greater or less extent anterior to the stricture; 6thly, the parts<br>
situated near the urethral fistula become so consolidated and confused<br>
that it is difficult in some and impossible in many cases to find the<br>
situation of the urethra, either by external examination or by means of<br>
the catheter passed into the canal. The original seat of the stricture<br>
becomes so masked by the surrounding disease, and the stricture itself,<br>
even if found by any chance, is generally of so impassable a kind, that<br>
it must be confessed there are few operations in surgery more irksome to<br>
a looker-on than is the fruitless effort made, in such a state of the<br>
parts, by a hand without a guide, to pass perforce a blunt pointed<br>
instrument like a catheter into the bladder. In some instances the<br>
stricture is slightly pervious, the urine passing in small quantity by<br>
the meatus. In others, the stricture is rendered wholly imperforate, and<br>
the canal either contracted or nearly obliterated anteriorly through<br>
disuse. Of these two conditions, the first is that in which catheterism<br>
may be tried with any reasonable hope of passing the instrument into the<br>
bladder. In the latter state, catheterism is useless, and the only means<br>
whereby the urethra may be rendered pervious in the proper direction is<br>
that of incising the stricture from the perinaeum, and after passing a<br>
catheter across the divided part into the bladder, to retain the<br>
instrument in this situation till the wound and the fistulae heal and<br>
close under the treatment proper for this end. (Mr. Syme.)<br>

Plate 57.--Figure 15.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 58.--In this figure the urethra appears communicating with<br>
a sac like a scrotum. A bougie is represented entering by the meatus,<br>
traversing the upper part of the sac, and passing into the membranous<br>
part of the urethra beyond. This case which was owing to a congenital<br>
malformation of the urethra, exhibits a dilatation of the canal such as<br>
might be produced behind a stricture wherever situated. The urine<br>
impelled forcibly by the whole action of the abdominal muscles against<br>
the obstructing part dilates the urethra behind the stricture, and by a<br>
repetition of such force the part gradually yields more and more, till<br>
it attains a very large size, and protrudes at the perinaeum as a<br>
distinct fluctuating tumour, every time that an effort is made to void<br>
the bladder. If the stricture in such a case happen to cause a complete<br>
retention of urine, and that a catheter cannot be passed into the<br>
bladder, the tumour should be punctured prior to taking measures for the<br>
removal of the stricture. (Sir B. Brodie.)<br>
<br>

Plate 58.--Figure 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 58, represents two close strictures of the urethra, one of<br>
which is situated at the bulb, and the other at the adjoining membranous<br>
part. These are the two situations in which strictures of the organic<br>
kind are said most frequently to occur, (Hunter, Home, Cooper, Brodie,<br>
Phillips, Velpeau.) False passages likewise are mentioned as more liable<br>
to be made in these places than elsewhere in the urethral canal. These<br>
occurrences--the disease and the accident--would seem to follow each<br>
other closely, like cause and consequence. The frequency with which<br>
false passages occur in this situation appears to me to be chiefly owing<br>
to the anatomical fact, that the urethra at and close to the bulb is the<br>
most dependent part of the curve, F K, Fig. 1, Plate 56; and hence, that<br>
instruments descending to this part from before push forcibly against<br>
the urethra, and are more apt to protrude through it than to have their<br>
points turned so as to ascend the curve towards the neck of the bladder.<br>
If it be also true that strictures happen here more frequently than<br>
elsewhere, this circumstance will of course favour the accident. An<br>
additional cause why the catheter happens to be frequently arrested at<br>
this situation and to perforate the canal, is owing to the fact, that<br>
the triangular ligament is liable to oppose it, the urethral opening in<br>
this structure not happening to coincide with the direction of the point<br>
of the instrument. In the figure, part of a bougie traverses the urethra<br>
through both strictures and lodges upon the enlarged prostate. Another<br>
instrument, after entering the first stricture, occupies a false passage<br>
which was made in the canal between the two constricted parts.<br>
<br>

Plate 58.--Figure 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 3, Plate 58.--A calculus is here represented lodging in the urethra<br>
at the bulb. The walls of the urethra around the calculus appear<br>
thickened. Behind the obstructing body the canal has become dilated,<br>
and, in front of it, contracted. In some instances the calculus presents<br>
a perforation through its centre, by which the urine escapes. In others,<br>
the urine makes its exit between the calculus and the side of the<br>
urethra, which it dilates. In this latter way the foreign body becomes<br>
loosened in the canal and gradually pushed forwards as far as the<br>
meatus, within which, owing to the narrowness of this aperture, it<br>
lodges permanently. If the calculus forms a complete obstruction to the<br>
passage of the urine, and its removal cannot be effected by other means,<br>
an incision should be made to effect this object.<br>

Fig. 4, Plate 58, represents the neck of the bladder and neighbouring<br>
part of the urethra of an ox, in which a polypous growth is seen<br>
attached by a long pedicle to the veru montanum and blocking up the neck<br>
of the bladder. Small irregular tubercles of organized lymph, and<br>
tumours formed by the lacunae distended by their own secretion, their<br>
orifices being closed by inflammation, are also found to obstruct the<br>
urethral canal.<br>

Plate 58.--Figure 8.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 9, Plate 58, represents the form of an old callous stricture half<br>
an inch long, situated midway between the bulb and the meatus. This is<br>
perhaps the most common site in which a stricture of this kind is found<br>
to exist. In some instances of old neglected cases the corpus spongiosum<br>
appears converted into a thick gristly cartilaginous mass, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">several</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">inches in extent</span>, the passage
here being very much contracted, and<br>
chiefly so at the middle of the stricture. When it becomes impossible to<br>
dilate or pass the canal of such a stricture by the ordinary means, it<br>
is recommended to divide the part by the lancetted stilette. (Stafford.)<br>
Division of the stricture, by any means, is no doubt the readiest and<br>
most effectual measure that can be adopted, provided we know clearly<br>
that the cutting instrument engages fairly the part to be divided. But<br>
this is a knowledge less likely to be attained if the stricture be<br>
situated behind than in front of the triangular ligament.<br>

the<br>
triangular ligament enclosing between its layers the artery of the bulb,<br>
Cowper's glands, the membranous urethra, and the muscular parts<br>
surrounding this portion of the canal. The fact that the flow of urine<br>
through the urethra happens occasionally to be <span
 style="font-style: italic;">suddenly</span> arrested, and<br>
this circumstance contrasted with the opposite fact that the organic<br>
stricture is of <span style="font-style: italic;">slow formation,</span>
originated the idea that the former<br>
occurrence arose from a spasmodic muscular contraction. By many this<br>
spasm was <span style="font-style: italic;">supposed</span> to be due
to the urethra being itself muscular. By<br>
others, it was <span style="font-style: italic;">demonstrated </span>as
being dependent upon the muscles which<br>
surround the membranous part of the urethra, and which act upon this<br>
part and constrict it. From my own observations I have formed the<br>
settled opinion that the urethra itself is not muscular. And though, on<br>
the one hand, I believe that this canal, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">per se, </span>never causes by active<br>
contraction the spasmodic form of stricture, I am far from supposing, on<br>
the other, that <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> sudden
