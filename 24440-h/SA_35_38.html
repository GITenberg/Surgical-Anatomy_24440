<br>
THE DISTINCTIVE DIAGNOSIS BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL<br>
INGUINAL HERNIAE, THE TAXIS, THE SEAT OF STRICTURE, AND THE OPERATION.<br>
<br>
A comparison of the relative position of these two varieties of herniae<br>
is in ordinary cases the chief means by which we can determine their<br>
distinctive diagnosis; but oftentimes they are found to exhibit such an<br>
interchange of characters, that the name <span
 style="font-style: italic;">direct</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">oblique</span> can no longer<br>
serve to distinguish between them. The nearer the one approaches the<br>
usual place of the other, the more likely are they to be mistaken the<br>
one for the other. An internal hernia may enter the inguinal canal, and<br>
become oblique; while an external hernia, though occupying the canal,<br>
may become direct. It is only when these herniae occur at the situations<br>
commonly described, and where they manifest their broadest contrast,<br>
that the following diagnostic signs can be observed.<br>
<br>
The external bubonocele, H, Plate 37, G, Plate 38, when recently formed,<br>
may be detected at a situation midway between the iliac and pubic<br>
spinous processes, where it has entered the internal ring. When the<br>
hernia extends itself from this part, its course will be obliquely<br>
inwards, corresponding with the direction of the inguinal canal. While<br>
it still occupies the canal without passing through the external ring,<br>
it is rendered obscure by the restraint of the external oblique tendon;<br>
but yet a degree of fulness may be felt in this situation. When the<br>
hernia has passed the external ring, T, Plate 36, it dilates<br>
considerably, and assumes the form of an oblong swelling, H, Plate 36,<br>
behind which the spermatic vessels are situated. When it has become<br>
scrotal, the cord will be found still on its posterior aspect, while the<br>
testicle itself occupies a situation directly below the swelling.<br>
<br>
The internal hernia, H, Plate 38, also traverses the external ring, T,<br>
where it assumes a globular shape, and sometimes projects so far<br>
inwards, over the pubes, C, as to conceal the crista of this bone. As<br>
the direction of this hernia is immediately from behind forwards, the<br>
inguinal canal near the internal ring is found empty, unswollen. The<br>
cord, Q, lies external to and somewhat over the fore part of this<br>
hernia; and the testicle does not occupy a situation exactly beneath the<br>
fundus of the sac, (as it does in the external hernia,) but is found to<br>
be placed either at its fore part or its outer side. This difference as<br>
to the relative position of the cord and testicle in both these forms of<br>
herniae, is accounted for under the supposition that whilst the external<br>
variety descends inside the sheaths of the inguinal canal, the internal<br>
variety does not. But this statement cannot apply to all cases of<br>
internal hernia, for this also occasionally enters the canal. Both forms<br>
of inguinal herniae may exist at the same time on the same side: the<br>
external, G, Plate 38, being a bubonocele, still occupying the inguinal<br>
canal; while the internal, H, protrudes through the external ring, T, in<br>
the usual way. In this form of hernia--a compound of the oblique and<br>
direct--while the parts remain still covered by the integuments, it must<br>
be difficult to tell its nature, or to distinguish any mark by which to<br>
diagnose the case from one of the external variety, H, Plate 36, which,<br>
on entering the canal at the internal ring, protrudes at the external<br>
ring. In both cases, the swelling produced in the groin must be exactly<br>
of the same size and shape. The epigastric artery in the case where the<br>
two herniae co-exist lies between them, holding in its usual position<br>
with respect to each when occurring separately--that is, on the outer<br>
side of the internal hernia, H, and on the inner side of the external<br>
one, G; and the external hernia, G, not having descended the canal as<br>
far as the external ring, T, allows the internal hernia, H, to assume<br>
its usual position with respect to the cord, Q. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Cases of this double hernia (external and internal) have been<br>
met with by Wilmer, Arnaud, Sandifort, Richter, and others. A plurality<br>
of the same variety of hernia may also occur on the same side. A<br>
complete and incomplete external inguinal hernia existing in the one<br>
groin, is recorded by Mr. Aston Key in his edition of Sir Astley<br>
Cooper's work on Hernia. Sir Astley Cooper states his having met with<br>
three internal inguinal herniae in each inguinal region. (Ing. et<br>
Congenit. Hernire.) ]<br>
<br>
Returning, however, to the more frequent conditions of inguinal<br>
hernia--viz., those in which either the direct or the oblique variety<br>
occurs alone--it should be remembered that a hernia originally oblique,<br>
H, Plates 35 and 37, may, when of long standing, and having attained a<br>
large size, destroy, by its gravitation, the obliquity of the inguinal<br>
canal to such a degree as to bring the internal, H, Plate 35, opposite<br>
to the external ring, as at I, and thereby exhibit all the appearance of<br>
a hernia originally direct, I, Plate 37. In such a case, the epigastric<br>
artery, F, which lies on the outer side of the neck of a truly direct<br>
hernia, I, Plate 37, will be found to course on the inner side, G, of<br>
the neck of this false-seeming direct hernia, I, Plate 35.<br>
<br>
In the trial made for replacing the protruded bowel by the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">taxis</span>, two<br>
circumstances should be remembered in order to facilitate this object:<br>
1st, the abdominal parietes should be relaxed by supporting the trunk<br>
forward, and at the same time flexing the thigh on the trunk; 2nd, as<br>
every complete hernial protrusion becomes distended more or less beyond<br>
the seat of stricture--wherever this may happen to be--its reduction by<br>
the taxis should be attempted, with gradual, gentle, equable pressure,<br>
so that the sac may be first emptied of its fluid. That part of the<br>
hernia which protruded last should be replaced first. The direction in<br>
which the hernia protrudes must always determine the direction in which<br>
it is to be reduced. If it be the external or oblique variety, the<br>
viscus is to be pushed upwards, outwards, and backwards; if it be the<br>
internal or direct variety, it is to be reduced by pressure, made<br>
upwards and backwards. Pressure made in this latter direction will serve<br>
for the reduction of that hernia which, from being originally external<br>
and oblique, has assumed the usual position of the internal or direct<br>
variety.<br>
<br>
The seat of the stricture in an external inguinal hernia is found to be<br>
situated either at the internal ring, corresponding to the neck of the<br>
sac, or at the external ring. Between these two points, which "bound the<br>
canal," and which are to be regarded merely as passive agents in causing<br>
stricture of the protruding bowel, the lower parts of the transversalis<br>
and internal oblique muscles embrace the herniary sac, and are known at<br>
times to be the cause of its active strangulation or spasm.<br>
<br>
The seat of stricture in an internal hernia may be either at the neck of<br>
its sac, I, Plate 37, or at the external ring, T, Plate 38; and<br>
according to the locality where this hernia enters the inguinal wall,<br>
the nature of its stricture will vary. If the hernia pass through a<br>
cleft in the conjoined tendon, <span style="font-style: italic;">f,</span>
Plate 38, this structure will<br>
constrict its neck all around. If it pass on the outer margin of this<br>
tendon, then the neck of the sac, bending inwards in order to gain the<br>
external ring, will be constricted against the sharp resisting edge of<br>
the tendon. Again, if the hernia enter the inguinal wall close to the<br>
epigastric artery, it will find its way into the inguinal canal, become<br>
invested by the structures forming this part, and here it may suffer<br>
active constriction from the muscular fibres of the transverse and<br>
internal oblique or their cremasteric parts. The external ring may be<br>
considered as always causing some degree of pressure on the hernia which<br>
passes through it.<br>
<br>
In both kinds of inguinal herniae, the neck of the sac is described as<br>
being occasionally the seat of stricture, and it certainly is so; but<br>
never from a cause originating in itself <span
 style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>, or independently of<br>
adjacent structures. The form of the sac of a hernia is influenced by<br>
the parts through which it passes, or which it pushes and elongates<br>
before itself. Its neck, H, Plate 37, is narrow at the internal ring of<br>
the fascia transversalis, because this ring is itself narrowed; it is<br>
again narrowed at the external ring, T, Plate 36, from the same cause.<br>
The neck of the sac of a direct hernia, I, Plate 37, being formed in the<br>
space of the separated fibres of the conjoined tendon, or the pubic part<br>
of the transversalis fascia, while the sac itself passes through the<br>
resisting tendinous external ring, is equal to the capacities of these<br>
outlets. But if these constricting outlets did not exist, the neck of<br>
the sac would be also wanting. When, however, the neck of the sac has<br>
existed in the embrace of these constricting parts for a considerable<br>
period--when it suffers inflammation and undergoes chronic<br>
thickening--then, even though we liberate the stricture of the internal<br>
ring or the external, the neck of the sac will be found to maintain its<br>
narrow diameter, and to have become itself a real seat of stricture. It<br>
is in cases of this latter kind of stricture that experience has<br>
demonstrated the necessity of opening the sac (a proceeding otherwise<br>
not only needless, but objectionable) and dividing its constricted neck.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact that the stricture may be seated in the neck of the sac<br>
independent of the internal ring, and also that the duplicature of the<br>
contained bowel may be adherent to the neck or other part of the<br>
interior, or that firm bands of false membrane may exist so as to<br>
constrict the bowel within the sac, are circumstances which require that<br>
this should be opened, and the state of its contained parts examined,<br>
prior to the replacement of the bowel in the abdomen. If the bowel were<br>
adherent to the neck of the sac, we might, when trying to reduce it by<br>
the taxis, produce visceral invagination; or while the stricture is in<br>
the neck of the sac, if we were to return this and its contents <span
 style="font-style: italic;">en masse</span><br>
(the "reduction en bloc") into the abdomen, it is obvious that the bowel<br>
would be still in a state of strangulation, though free of the internal<br>
ring or other opening in the inguinal wall.<br>
<br>
The operation for the division of the stricture by the knife is<br>
conducted in the following way: an incision is to be made through the<br>
integuments, adipous membrane, and superficial fascia, of a length and<br>
depth sufficient to expose the tendon of the external oblique muscle for<br>
an inch or so above the external ring; and the hernia for the same<br>
extent below the ring. The length of the incision will require to be<br>
varied according to circumstances, but its direction should be oblique<br>
with that of the hernia itself, and also over the centre of its<br>
longitudinal axis, so as to avoid injuring the spermatic vessels. If the<br>
constriction of the hernia be caused by the external ring, a director is<br>
to be inserted beneath this part, and a few of its fibres divided. But<br>
when the stricture is produced by either of the muscles which lie<br>
beneath the aponeurosis of the external oblique, it will be necessary to<br>
divide this part in order to expose and incise them.<br>
<br>
When the thickened and indurated neck of the sac is felt to be the cause<br>
of the strangulation, or when the bowel cannot be replaced, in<br>
consequence of adhesions which it may have contracted with some part of<br>
the sac, it then becomes necessary to open this envelope. And now the<br>
position of the epigastric artery is to be remembered, so as to avoid<br>
wounding it in the incision about to be made through the constricted<br>
neck of the sac. The artery being situated on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">inner side of the neck</span><br>
of the sac of an oblique hernia, requires the incision to be made<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">outwards</span> from the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">external side of the neck</span>; whereas
in the direct<br>
hernia, the artery being on its <span style="font-style: italic;">outer
side</span>, the incision should be<br>
conducted <span style="font-style: italic;">inwards</span> from <span
 style="font-style: italic;">the inner side of the neck</span>. But as
the external<br>
or oblique hernia may by its weight, in process of time, gravitate so<br>
far inwards as to assume the position and appearance of a hernia<br>
originally direct and internal, and as by this change of place the<br>
oblique hernia, becoming direct as to position, does not at the same<br>
time become internal in respect to the epigastric artery,--for this<br>
vessel, F, Plate 35, has been borne inwards to the place, G, where it<br>
still lies, internal to the neck of the sac, and since, moreover, it is<br>
very difficult to diagnose a case of this kind with positive certainty,<br>
it is therefore recommended to incise the stricture at the neck of the<br>
sac in a line carried <span style="font-style: italic;">directly
upwards</span>. (Sir Astley Cooper.) It will be<br>
seen, however, on referring to Plates 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, &amp; 38,
that<br>
an incision carried <span style="font-style: italic;">obliquely upwards</span>
towards the umbilicus would be<br>
much more likely to avoid the epigastric artery through all its varying<br>
relations.<br>
