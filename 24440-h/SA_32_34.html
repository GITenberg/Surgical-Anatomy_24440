COMMENTARY ON PLATES 32, 33, &amp; 34.<br>
<br>
THE DISSECTION OF THE OBLIQUE OR EXTERNAL AND<br>
THE DIRECT OR INTERNAL INGUINAL HERNIAE.<br>
<br>
The order in which the herniary bowel takes its investments from the<br>
eight layers of the inguinal region, is precisely the reverse of that<br>
order in which these layers present in the dissection from before<br>
backwards. The innermost layer of the inguinal region is the<br>
peritonaeum, and from this membrane the intestine, when about to<br>
protrude, derives its first covering. This covering constitutes the<br>
hernial sac. Almost all varieties of inguinal herniae are said to be<br>
enveloped in a sac, or elongation of the peritonaeum. This is accounted<br>
as the general rule. The exceptions to the rule are mentioned as<br>
occurring in the following modes: 1st, the caecum and sigmoid flexure of<br>
the colon, which are devoid of mesenteries, and only partially covered<br>
by the peritonaeum, may slip down behind this membrane, and become<br>
hernial; 2nd, the inguinal part of the peritonaeum may suffer rupture,<br>
and allow the intestine to protrude through the opening. When a hernia<br>
occurs under either of these circumstances, it will be found deprived of<br>
a sac.<br>
<br>
All the blood vessels and nerves of the abdomen lie external to the<br>
peritonaeum. Those vessels which traverse the abdomen on their way to<br>
the external organs course outside the peritonaeum; and at the places<br>
where they enter the abdominal parietes, the membrane is reflected from<br>
them. This disposition of the peritonaeum in respect to the spermatic<br>
and iliac vessels is exhibited in Plate 32.<br>
<br>
The part of the peritonaeum which lines the inguinal parietes does not<br>
(in the normal state of the adult body) exhibit any aperture<br>
corresponding to that named the internal ring. The membrane is in this<br>
place, as elsewhere, continuous throughout, being extended over the<br>
ring, as also over other localities, where subjacent structures may be<br>
in part wanting. It is in these places, where the membrane happens to be<br>
unsupported, that herniae are most liable to occur. And it must be<br>
added, that the natural form of the internal surface of the groin is<br>
such as to guide the viscera under pressure directly against those parts<br>
which are the weakest.<br>
<br>
The inner surface of the groin is divided into two pouches or fossae, by<br>
an intervening crescentic fold of the peritonaeum, which corresponds<br>
with the situation of the epigastric vessels. This fold is formed by the<br>
epigastric vessels and the umbilical ligament, which, being tenser and<br>
shorter than the peritonaeum, thereby cause this membrane to project.<br>
The outer fossa represents a triangular space, the apex of which is<br>
below, at P; the base being formed by the fibres of the transverse<br>
muscle above; the inner side by the epigastric artery; and the outer<br>
side by Poupart's ligament. The apex of this inverted triangle is<br>
opposite the internal ring. The inner fossa is bounded by the epigastric<br>
artery externally; by the margin of the rectus muscle internally; and by<br>
the os pubis and inner end of Poupart's ligament inferiorly. The inner<br>
fossa is opposite the external abdominal ring, and is known as the<br>
triangle of Hesselbach.<br>
<br>
The two peritonaeal fossae being named external and internal, in<br>
reference to the situation of the epigastric vessels, we find that the<br>
two varieties of inguinal herniae which occur in these fossae are named<br>
external and internal also, in reference to the same part.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">external</span> inguinal hernia,
so called from its commencing in the outer<br>
peritonaeal fossa, on the outer side of the epigastric artery, takes a<br>
covering from the peritonaeum of this place, and pushes forward into the<br>
internal abdominal ring at the point marked P, Plate 32. In this place,<br>
the incipient hernia or bubonocele, covered by its sac, lies on the<br>
forepart of the spermatic vessels, and becomes invested by those same<br>
coverings which constitute the inguinal canal, through which these<br>
vessels pass. In this stage of the hernia, its situation in respect to<br>
the epigastric artery is truly external, and in respect to the spermatic<br>
vessels, anterior, while the protruded intestine itself is separated<br>
from actual contact with either of these vessels by its proper sac. The<br>
bubonocele, projecting through the internal ring at the situation marked<br>
F, (Plate 33,) midway between A, the anterior iliac spine, and I, the<br>
pubic spine, continues to increase in size; but as its further progress<br>
from behind directly forwards becomes arrested by the tense resisting<br>
aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h, </span>it changes its course<br>
obliquely inwards along the canal, traversing this canal with the<br>
spermatic vessels, which still lie behind it, and, lastly, makes its<br>
exit at the external ring, H. The obliquity of this course, pursued by<br>
the hernia, from the internal to the external ring, has gained for it<br>
the name of <span style="font-style: italic;">oblique</span> hernia.
In this stage of the hernial protrusion, the<br>
only part of it which may be truly named external is the neck of its<br>
sac, F, for the elongated body, G, of the hernia lies now actually in<br>
front of the epigastric artery, P, and this vessel is separated from the<br>
anterior wall of the canal, H <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>,
by an interval equal to the bulk of the<br>
hernia. While the hernia occupies the canal, F H, without projecting<br>
through the external ring, H, it is named "incomplete." When it has<br>
passed the external ring, H, so as to form a tumour of the size and in<br>
the situation of <span style="font-style: italic;">f g</span>, it is
named "complete." When, lastly, the hernia<br>
has extended itself so far as to occupy the whole length of the cord,<br>
and reach the scrotum, it is termed "scrotal hernia." These names, it<br>
will be seen, are given only to characterise the several stages of the<br>
one kind of hernia--viz., that which commences to form at a situation<br>
external to the epigastric artery, and, after following the course of<br>
the spermatic vessels through the inguinal canal, at length terminates<br>
in the scrotum.<br>
<br>
The external inguinal hernia having entered the canal, P, (Plate 32,) at<br>
a situation immediately in front of the spermatic vessels, continues, in<br>
the several stages of its descent, to hold the same relation to these<br>
vessels through the whole length of the canal, even as far as the<br>
testicle in the scrotum. This hernia, however, when of long standing and<br>
large size, is known to separate the spermatic vessels from each other<br>
in such a way, that some are found to lie on its fore part--others to<br>
its outer side. However great may be the size of this hernia, even when<br>
it becomes scrotal, still the testicle is invariably found below it.<br>
This fact is accounted for by the circumstance, that the lower end of<br>
the spermatic envelopes is attached so firmly to the coats of the<br>
testicle as to prevent the hernia from either distending and elongating<br>
them to a level below this organ, or from entering the cavity of the<br>
tunica vaginalis.<br>
<br>
The external form of inguinal hernia is, comparatively speaking, but<br>
rarely seen in the female. When it does occur in this sex, its position,<br>
investments, and course through the inguinal canal, where it accompanies<br>
the round ligament of the uterus, are the same as in the male. When the<br>
hernia escapes through the external abdominal ring of the female groin,<br>
it is found to lodge in the labium pudendi. In the male body, the<br>
testicle and spermatic cord, which have carried before them investments<br>
derived from all the layers of the inguinal region, have, as it were,<br>
already marked out the track to be followed by the hernia, and prepared<br>
for it its several coverings. The muscular parietes of the male inguinal<br>
region, from which the loose cremaster muscle has been derived, have by<br>
this circumstance become weakened, and hence the more frequent<br>
occurrence of external inguinal hernia in the male. But in the female,<br>
where no such process has taken place, and where a cremaster does not<br>
exist at the expense of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, the<br>
inguinal parietes remain more compact, and are less liable to suffer<br>
distention in the course of the uterine ligament.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">internal</span> inguinal hernia
takes its peritonaeal covering (the sac)<br>
from the inner fossa, Q R, Plate 32, internal to the epigastric artery,<br>
and forces directly forwards through the external abdominal ring,<br>
carrying investments from each of such structures as it meets with in<br>
this locality of the groin. As the external ring, H, Plate 34, is<br>
opposite the inner peritonaeal fossa, Q R, Plate 32, this hernia, which<br>
protrudes thus immediately from behind forwards, is also named <span
 style="font-style: italic;">direct.</span><br>
In this way these two varieties of hernia, (the external, Plate 33, and<br>
the internal, Plate 34,) though commencing in different situations, P<br>
and R, Plate 32, within the abdomen, arrive at the same place--viz., the<br>
external ring, H, Plates 33 and 34. The coverings of the internal<br>
hernia, Plate 34, though not derived exactly from the same locality as<br>
those which invest the cord and the external variety, are, nevertheless,<br>
but different parts of the same structures; these are, 1st, the<br>
peritonaeum, G, which forms its sac; 2nd, the pubic part of the fascia<br>
transversalis; 3rd, the conjoined tendon itself, or (according as the<br>
hernia may occur further from the mesial line) the cremaster, which, in<br>
common with the internal oblique and transverse muscles, terminates in<br>
this tendon; 4th, the external spermatic fascia, derived from the<br>
margins of the external ring; 5th, the superficial fascia and<br>
integuments.<br>
<br>
The coverings of the internal inguinal hernia are (as to number)<br>
variously described by authors. Thus with respect to the conjoined<br>
tendon, the hernia is said, in some instances, to take an investment of<br>
this structure; in others, to pass through a cleft in its fibres; in<br>
others, to escape by its outer margin. Again, the cremaster muscle is<br>
stated by some to cover this hernia; by others, to be rarely met with,<br>
as forming one of its coverings; and by others, never. Lastly, it is<br>
doubted by some whether this hernia is even covered by a protrusion of<br>
the fascia transversalis in all instances. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Mr. Lawrence (Treatise on Ruptures) remarks, "How often it<br>
may be invested by a protrusion of the fascia transversalis, I cannot<br>
hitherto determine." Mr. Stanley has presented to St. Bartholomew's<br>
Hospital several specimens of this hernia invested by the fascia.<br>
Hesselbach speaks of the fascia as being always present. Cloquet<br>
mentions it as being present always, except in such cases as where, by<br>
being ruptured, the sac protrudes through it. Langenbeck states that the<br>
fascia is constantly protruded as a covering to this hernia: "Quia<br>
hernia inguinalis interna non in canalis abdominalis aperturam internam<br>
transit, tunicam vaginalem communem intrare nequit; parietem autem<br>
canalis abdominalis internum aponeuroticum, in quo fovea inguinalis<br>
interna, et qui ex adverso annulo abdominali est, ante se per annulum<br>
trudit." (Comment, ad illust. Herniarum, &amp;c.) Perhaps the readiest
and<br>
surest explanation which can be given to these differences of opinion<br>
may be had from the following remark:--"Culter enim semper has partes<br>
extricat, quae involucro adeo inhaerent, ut pro lubitu musculum<br>
(membranam) efformare queas unde magnam illam inter anatomicos<br>
discrepantiam ortam conjicio." (Camper. Icones Herniarum.)]<br>
<br>
The variety in the number of investments of the internal inguinal hernia<br>
(especially as regards the presence or absence of the conjoined tendon<br>
and cremaster) appears to me to be dependent, 1st, upon the position<br>
whereat this hernia occurs; 2nd, upon the state of the parts through<br>
which it passes; and 3rd, upon the manner in which the dissection<br>
happens to be conducted.<br>
<br>
The precise relations which the internal hernia holds in respect to the<br>
epigastric and spermatic vessels are also mainly dependent (as in the<br>
external variety) upon the situation where it traverses the groin. The<br>
epigastric artery courses outside the neck of its sac, sometimes in<br>
close connexion with this part--at other times, at some distance from<br>
it, according as the neck may happen to be wide and near the vessel, or<br>
narrow, and removed from it nearer to the median line. At the external<br>
ring, H, (Plate 34,) the sac of this hernia, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g</span>, protrudes on the inner<br>
side of the spermatic vessels, <span style="font-style: italic;">f;</span>
and the size of the hernia distending<br>
the ring, removes these vessels at a considerable interval from, I, the<br>
crista pubis. At the ring, H, (Plate 34,) the investments, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g f</span>, of the<br>
direct hernia are not <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span>
distinct from those of the oblique hernia,<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">g f</span>, (Plate 33); for whilst in
both varieties the intestine and the<br>
spermatic vessels are separated from actual contact by the sac, yet it<br>
is true that the direct hernia, as well as the oblique, may occupy the<br>
inguinal canal. It is in relation to the epigastric artery alone that<br>
the direct hernia differs essentially from the oblique variety; for I<br>
find that both may be enclosed in the same structures as invest the<br>
spermatic vessels.<br>
<br>
The external ring of the male groin is larger than that of the female;<br>
and this circumstance, with others of a like nature, may account for the<br>
fact, that the female is very rarely the subject of the direct hernia.<br>
In the male, the direct hernia is found to occur much less frequently<br>
than the oblique, and this we might, <span style="font-style: italic;">a
priori,</span> expect, from the<br>
anatomical disposition of the parts. But it is true, nevertheless, that<br>
the part where the direct hernia occurs is not defended so completely in<br>
some male bodies as it is in others. The conjoined tendon, which is<br>
described as shielding the external ring, is in some cases very weak,<br>
and in others so narrow, as to offer but little support to this part of<br>
the groin.<br>
