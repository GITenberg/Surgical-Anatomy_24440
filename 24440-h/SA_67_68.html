<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATES 67 &amp; 68.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE ANTERIOR CRURAL REGION,<br>
THE ANKLES, AND THE FOOT.<br>
<br>
Beneath the integuments and subcutaneous adipose tissue on the fore part<br>
of the leg and foot, the fascia H H, Plate 67, Figure 2, is to be seen<br>
stretched over the muscles and sending processes between them, thus<br>
encasing each of these in a special sheath.<br>
<br>
The fascia is here of considerable density. It is attached on the inner<br>
side of the leg to the spine of the tibia, D, Plate 67, Figure 2, and on<br>
the outer side it passes over the peronaeal muscles to those forming the<br>
calf. Between the extensor communis digitorum, B <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, and the peronaeus<br>
longus, F, it sends in a strong process to be attached to the fibula, E.<br>
In front of the ankle joint, the fascia is increased in density,<br>
constituting a band (anterior annular ligament) which extends between<br>
the malleoli, forms sheaths for the several extensor tendons, and binds<br>
these down in front of the joint. From the lower border of the annular<br>
ligament, the fascia is continued over the dorsum of the foot, forming<br>
sheaths for the tendons and muscles of this part. Behind the inner<br>
malleolus, <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, Plate 67,
Figure 1, the fascia attached to this process<br>
and to the inner side of the os calcis appears as the internal annular<br>
ligament, which being broad and strong, forms a kind of arch, beneath<br>
which in special sheaths the flexor tendons, and the posterior tibial<br>
vessel and nerve, pass to the sole of the foot. On tracing the fascia<br>
from the front to the back of the leg, it will be seen to divide into<br>
two layers--superficial and deep; the former passes over the muscles of<br>
the calf and their common tendon (tendo Achillis) to which it adheres,<br>
while the latter passes between these muscles and the deep flexors. The<br>
deep layer is that which immediately overlies the posterior tibial and<br>
peronaeal vessels and nerves. While exposing the fascia on the forepart<br>
of the leg and dorsum of the foot, we meet with the musculo-cutaneous<br>
branch of the peronaeal nerve, which pierces the fascia at about the<br>
middle of the limb, and descends superficially in a direction between<br>
the fibula, and the extensor longus digitorum muscle, and after dividing<br>
into branches a little above the outer ankle, these traverse in two<br>
groups the dorsum of the foot, to be distributed to the integuments of<br>
the five toes. On the inner side of the tibia, D, Plate 67, Figure 1,<br>
will be seen the internal or long saphena vein, B B, which commencing by<br>
numerous branches on the dorsal surface of the foot ascends in front of<br>
the inner ankle, <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, to gain
the inner side of the leg, after which it<br>
ascends behind the inner side of the knee and thigh, till it terminates<br>
at the saphenous opening, where it joins the femoral vein. In its course<br>
along the lower part of the thigh, the leg and the foot, this vein is<br>
closely accompanied by the long saphenous nerve, derived from the<br>
anterior crural, and also by a group of lymphatics.<br>
<br>
By removing the fascia from the front of the leg and foot, we expose the<br>
several muscles and tendons which are situated in these parts. In the<br>
upper part of the leg the tibialis anticus, A, Plate 67, Figure 2, and<br>
extensor-communis muscle, B, are adherent to the fascia which covers<br>
them, and to the intermuscular septum which divides them. In the lower<br>
part of the leg where these muscles and the extensor pollicis, C,<br>
terminate in tendons, <span style="font-style: italic;">a b c,</span>
they are readily separable from one<br>
another. The tibialis anticus lies along the outer side of the tibia,<br>
from which, and from the head of the fibula and interosseous ligament,<br>
it arises tendinous and fleshy. This muscle is superficial in its whole<br>
length; its tendon commencing about the middle of the leg, passes in a<br>
separate loose sheath of the annular ligament in front of the inner<br>
ankle, to be inserted into the inner side of the cuneiform bone and base<br>
of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The extensor communis digitorum<br>
lies close to the outer side of the anterior tibial muscle, and arises<br>
from the upper three-fourths of the fibula, from the interosseous<br>
ligament and intermuscular septum. At the lower part of the leg, this<br>
muscle ends in three or four flat tendons, which pass through a ring of<br>
the annular ligament, and extending forwards, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b b b b</span>, over the dorsum<br>
of the foot, become inserted into the four outer toes. The peronaeus<br>
tertius or anterior, is that part of the common extensor muscle which is<br>
inserted into the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. On separating the<br>
anterior tibial and common extensor muscles, we find the extensor<br>
pollicis, C <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, which,
concealed between the two, arises from the middle<br>
of the fibula, and the interosseous ligament; its tendon passes beneath<br>
the annular ligament in front of the ankle joint, and after traversing<br>
the inner part of the dorsum of the foot, becomes inserted into the<br>
three phalanges of the great toe. Beneath the tendons of the extensor<br>
communis on the instep, will be seen the extensor digitorum brevis, K K,<br>
lying in an oblique direction, between the upper and outer part of the<br>
os calcis, from which it arises, and the four inner toes, into each of<br>
which it is inserted by a small flat tendon, which joins the<br>
corresponding tendon of the long common extensor.<br>
<br>
The anterior tibial artery, L, Plate 67, Figure 2, extends from the<br>
upper part of the interosseous ligament which it perforates, to the bend<br>
of the ankle, whence it is continued over the dorsum of the foot. In the<br>
upper third of the leg, the anterior tibial artery lies deeply situated<br>
between the tibialis anticus, and flexor communis muscles. Here it will<br>
be found, close in front of the interosseous ligament, at about an inch<br>
and-a-half in depth from the anterior surface, and removed from the<br>
spine of the tibia at an interval equal to the width of the tibialis<br>
anticus muscle. In its course down the leg, the vessel passes obliquely<br>
from a point close to the inner side of the neck of the fibula, to<br>
midway between the ankles. In its descent, it becomes gradually more<br>
superficial. In the middle of the leg, the vessel passes between the<br>
extensor longus pollicis, and the tibialis anticus muscles. Above,<br>
beneath, and below the annular ligament, this artery will be found to<br>
pass midway between the extensor pollicis tendon, and those of the<br>
extensor communis, and to hold the same relation to these parts in<br>
traversing the dorsum of the foot, till it gains the interval between<br>
the two inner metatarsal bones, where it divides into two branches, one<br>
of which passes forwards in the first interdigital space, while the<br>
other sinks between the bones, to inosculate with the plantar arteries.<br>
The innermost tendon of the short common extensor crosses in front of<br>
the dorsal artery of the foot near its termination. Between the ankle<br>
and the first interosseous space the artery lies comparatively<br>
superficial, being here covered only by the skin and fascia and cellular<br>
membrane. Two veins accompany the anterior tibial artery and its<br>
continuation on the dorsum of the foot. The anterior tibial nerve, a<br>
branch of the peronaeal, joins the outer side of the artery, about the<br>
middle of the leg, and accompanies it closely in this position, till<br>
both have passed beneath the annular ligament. On the dorsum of the foot<br>
the nerve will be found to the inner side of the artery.<br>
<br>
The branches of the anterior tibial artery are articular and muscular.<br>
From its upper end arises the recurrent branch which anastomoses in<br>
front of the knee with the articular branches of the popliteal artery.<br>
Near the ankle, arise on either side of the vessel two malleolar<br>
branches, internal and external, the former communicating with branches<br>
of the posterior tibial, the latter with those of the peronaeal.<br>
Numerous muscular branches arise, at short intervals, from the vessel in<br>
its passage down the leg. Tarsal, metatarsal, and small digital branches<br>
spring from the dorsal artery of the foot. The anterior tibial artery is<br>
rarely found to deviate from its usual course; in some cases it appears<br>
of less or of greater size than usual. When this vessel appears<br>
deficient, its place is usually supplied by some branch of the peronaeal<br>
or posterior tibial, which pierces the interosseous ligament from<br>
behind.<br>
<br>
The anterior tibial artery when requiring a ligature to be applied to it<br>
in any part of its course, may be exposed by an incision, extending for<br>
three or four inches, (more or less, according to the depth of the<br>
vessel) along the outer border of the tibialis anticus muscle. The<br>
fibrous septum between this muscle and the extensor communis, will serve<br>
as a guide to the vessel in the upper third of the leg, where it lies<br>
deeply on the interosseous ligament. In the middle of the leg, the<br>
vessel is to be sought for between the anterior tibial and extensor<br>
longus pollicis muscles. In the lower part of the leg, and on the dorsum<br>
of the foot, it will be found between the extensor longus pollicis, and<br>
extensor communis tendons, the former being taken as a guide for the<br>
incision. In passing the ligature around this vessel at either of these<br>
situations, care is required to avoid including the venae comites and<br>
the accompanying nerve.<br>
<br>
The sole of the foot is covered by a hard and thick integument, beneath<br>
which will be seen a large quantity of granulated adipose tissue so<br>
intersected by bands of fibrous structure as to form a firm, but elastic<br>
cushion, in the situations particularly of the heel and joints of the<br>
toes. On removing this structure, we expose the plantar fascia, B, Plate<br>
68, Figure 1, extending from the os calcis, A, to the toes. This fascia<br>
is remarkably strong, especially its middle and outer parts, which serve<br>
to retain the arched form of the foot, and thereby to protect the<br>
plantar structures from superincumbent pressure during the erect<br>
posture. The superficial plantar muscles become exposed on removing the<br>
plantar fascia, to which they adhere. In the centre will be seen the<br>
thick fleshy flexor digitorum brevis muscle, B, arising from the<br>
inferior part of the os calcis, and passing forwards to divide into four<br>
small tendons, <span style="font-style: italic;">b b b b,</span> for
the four outer toes. On the inner side of<br>
the foot appears the abductor pollicis, D, arising from the inner side<br>
of the os calcis and internal annular ligament, and passing to be<br>
inserted with the flexor pollicis brevis, H, into the sesamoid bones and<br>
base of the first phalanx of the great toe. On the external border of<br>
the foot is situated the abductor minimi digiti, C, arising from the<br>
outer side of the os calcis, and passing to be inserted with the flexor<br>
brevis minimi digiti into the base of the first phalanx of the little<br>
toe. When the flexor brevis digitorum muscle is removed, the plantar<br>
arteries, L M, and nerves, are brought partially into view; and by<br>
further dividing the abductor pollicis, D, their continuity with the<br>
posterior tibial artery and nerves, K L, Plate 67, Figure 1, behind the<br>
inner ankle may be seen.<br>
<br>
The plantar branches of the posterior tibial artery are the internal and<br>
external, both of which are deeply placed between the superficial and<br>
deep plantar muscles. The internal plantar artery is much the smaller of<br>
the two. The external plantar artery, L, Plate 68, Figure 1, is large,<br>
and seems to be the proper continuation of the posterior tibial. It<br>
corresponds, in the foot, to the deep palmar arch in the hand. Placed at<br>
first between the origin of the abductor pollicis and the calcaneum, the<br>
external plantar artery passes outwards between the short common flexor,<br>
B, and the flexor accessorius, E, to gain the inner borders of the<br>
muscles of the little toe; from this place it curves deeply inwards<br>
between the tendons of the long common flexor of the toes, F <span
 style="font-style: italic;">f f,</span> and<br>
the tarso-metatarsal joints, to gain the outer side of the first<br>
metatarsal bone, H, Plate 68, Figure 2. In this course it is covered in<br>
its posterior half by the flexor brevis digitorum, and in its anterior<br>
half by this muscle, together with the tendons of the long flexor, F,<br>
Plate 68, Figure 1, of the toes and the lumbricales muscles, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">i i i i.</span><br>
From the external plantar artery are derived the principal branches for<br>
supplying the structures in the sole of the foot. The internal plantar<br>
nerve divides into four branches, for the supply of the four inner toes,<br>
to which they pass between the superficial and deep flexors. The<br>
external plantar nerve, passing along the inner side of the<br>
corresponding artery, sends branches to supply the outer toe and<br>
adjacent side of the next, and then passes, with the artery, between the<br>
deep common flexor tendon and the metatarsus, to be distributed to the<br>
deep plantar muscles.<br>
<br>
The posterior tibial artery may be tied behind the inner ankle, on being<br>
laid bare in the following way:--A curved incision (the concavity<br>
forwards) of two inches in length, is to be made midway between the<br>
tendo Achillis and the ankle. The skin and superficial fascia having<br>
been divided, we expose the inner annular ligament, which will be found<br>
enclosing the vessels and nerve in a canal distinct from that of the<br>
tendons. Their fibrous sheath having been slit open, the artery will be<br>
seen between the venae comites, and with the nerve, in general, behind<br>
it.<br>
<br>
When any of the arteries of the leg or the foot are wounded, and the<br>
haemorrhage cannot be commanded by compression, it will be necessary to<br>
search for the divided ends of the vessel in the wound, and to apply a<br>
ligature to both. The expediency of this measure must become fully<br>
apparent when we consider the frequent anastomoses existing between the<br>
collateral branches of the crural arteries, and that a ligature applied<br>
to <span style="font-style: italic;">any one</span> of these above the
seat of injury will not arrest the<br>
recurrent circulation through the vessels of the foot.<br>
