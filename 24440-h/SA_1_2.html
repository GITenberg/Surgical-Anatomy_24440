<br>
THE FORM OF THE THORACIC CAVITY, AND THE POSITION OF THE LUNGS,<br>
HEART, AND LARGER BLOODVESSELS.<br>
<br>
In the human body there does not exist any such space as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cavity</span>,<br>
properly so called. Every space is occupied by its contents. The<br>
thoracic space is completely filled by its viscera, which, in mass, take<br>
a perfect cast or model of its interior. The thoracic viscera lie so<br>
closely to one another, that they respectively influence the form and<br>
dimensions of each other. That space which the lungs do not occupy is<br>
filled by the heart, &amp;c., and <span style="font-style: italic;">vice
versa</span>. The thoracic apparatus
causes<br>
no vacuum by the acts of either contraction or dilatation. Neither do<br>
the lungs or the heart. When any organ, by its process of growth, or by<br>
its own functional act, forces a space for itself, it immediately<br>
inhabits that space entirely at the expense of neighbouring organs. When<br>
the heart dilates, the pulmonary space contracts; and when the thoracic<br>
space increases, general space diminishes in the same ratio.<br>
<br>
The mechanism of the functions of respiration and circulation consists,<br>
during the life of the animal, in a constant oscillatory <span
 style="font-style: italic;">nisus</span> to<br>
produce a vacuum which it never establishes. These vital forces of the<br>
respiratory and circulatory organs, so characteristic of the higher<br>
classes of animals, are opposed to the general forces of surrounding<br>
nature. The former vainly strive to make exception to the irrevocable<br>
law, that "<span style="font-style: italic;">nature abhors a vacuum</span>."
This act of opposition between both<br>
forces constitutes the respiratory act, and thus the respiratory<br>
thoracic being (like a vibrating pendulum) manifests respiratory motion,<br>
not as an effort of volition originating solely with itself, but<br>
according to the measure of the force of either law; as entity is<br>
relationary, so is functionality likewise. The being is functional by<br>
relationship; and just as a pendulum is functional, by reason of the<br>
counteraction of two opposing forces,--viz., the force of motion and the<br>
force of gravity,--so is a thoracic cavity (considering it as a<br>
mechanical apparatus) functional by two opposing forces--the vital force<br>
and the surrounding physical force. The inspiration of thoracic space is<br>
the expiration of general space, and reciprocally.<br>
<br>
The thoracic space is a symmetrical enclosure originally, which<br>
aftercoming necessities modify and distort in some degree. The spaces<br>
occupied by the opposite lungs in the adult body do not exactly<br>
correspond as to capacity, O O, Plate 1. Neither is the cardiac space, A<br>
E G D, Plate 1, which is traversed by the common median line,<br>
symmetrical. The asymmetry of the lungs is mainly owing to the form and<br>
position of the heart; for this organ inclines towards the left thoracic<br>
side. The left lung is less in capacity than the right, by so much space<br>
as the heart occupies in the left pulmonary side. The general form of<br>
the thorax is that of a cone, I I N N, Plate 1, bicleft through its<br>
perpendicular axis, H M. The line of bicleavage is exactly median, and<br>
passes through the centre of the sternum in front, and the centres of<br>
the dorsal vertebral behind. Between the dorsal vertebral and the<br>
sternum, the line of median cleavage is maintained and sketched out in<br>
membrane. This membranous middle is formed by the adjacent sides of the<br>
opposite pleural or enveloping bags in which the lungs are enclosed. The<br>
heart, A, Plate 1, is developed between these two pleural sacs, F F, and<br>
separates them from each other to a distance corresponding to its own<br>
size. The adjacent sides of the two pleural sacs are central to the<br>
thorax, and form that space which is called mediastinum; the heart is<br>
located in this mediastinum, U E, Plate 1. The extent of the thoracic<br>
region ranges <span style="font-style: italic;">perpendicularly</span>
from the root of the neck, Q, Plate 1, to<br>
the roof of the abdomen--viz., the diaphragm, P, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">transversely</span> from the<br>
ribs of one side, I N, Plate 1, to those of the other, and<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">antero-posteriorly</span> from the
sternum, H M, to the vertebral column. All<br>
this space is pulmonary, except the cardiac or median space, which, in<br>
addition to the heart, A, Plate 1, and great bloodvessels, G C B,<br>
contains the oesophagus, bronchi, &amp;c. The ribs are the true
enclosures<br>
of thoracic space, and, generally, in mammalian forms, they fail or<br>
degenerate at that region of the trunk which is not pulmonary or<br>
respiratory. In human anatomy, a teleological reason is given for<br>
this--namely, that of the ribs being mechanically subservient to the<br>
function of respiration alone. But the transcendental anatomists<br>
interpret this fact otherwise, and refer it to the operation of a higher<br>
law of formation.<br>
<br>
The capacity of the thorax is influenced by the capacity of the abdomen<br>
and its contents. In order to admit of full inspiration and pulmonary<br>
expansion, the abdominal viscera recede in the same ratio as the lungs<br>
dilate. The diaphragm, P P, Plate 1, or transverse musculo-membranous<br>
partition which divides the pulmonary and alimentary cavities, is, by<br>
virtue of its situation, as mechanically subservient to the abdomen as<br>
to the thorax. And under general notice, it will appear that even the<br>
abdominal muscles are as directly related to the respiratory act as<br>
those of the thorax. The connexion between functions is as intimate and<br>
indissoluble as the connexion between organs in the same body. There can<br>
be no more striking proof of the divinity of design than by such<br>
revelations as anatomical science everywhere manifests in facts such as<br>
this--viz., that each organ serves in most cases a double, and in many a<br>
triple purpose, in the animal economy.<br>
<br>
The apex of the lung projects into the root of the neck, even to a<br>
higher level, Q, Plate 1, than that occupied by the sternal end of the<br>
clavicle, K. If the point of a sword were pushed through the neck above<br>
the clavicle, at K, Plate 1, it would penetrate the apex of the right<br>
lung, where the subclavian artery, Q, Plate 1, arches over it. In<br>
connexion with this fact, I may mention it as very probable that the<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">bruit</span>, or continuous murmur
which we hear through the stethoscope, in<br>
chlorotic females, is caused by the pulsation of the subclavian artery<br>
against the top of the lung. The stays or girdle which braces the loins<br>
of most women prevents the expansion of the thoracic apparatus,<br>
naturally attained by the descent of the diaphragm; and hence, no doubt,<br>
the lung will distend inordinately above towards the neck. It is an<br>
interesting fact for those anatomists who study the higher<br>
generalizations of their science, that at those very localities--viz.,<br>
the neck and loins, where the lungs by their own natural effort are<br>
prone to extend themselves in forced inspiration--happen the "anomalous"<br>
creations of cervical and lumbar ribs. The subclavian artery is<br>
occasionally complicated by the presence of these costal appendages.<br>
<br>
If the body be transfixed through any one of the intercostal spaces, the<br>
instrument will surely wound some part of the lung. If the thorax be<br>
pierced from any point whatever, provided the instrument be directed<br>
towards a common centre, A, Plate 1, the lung will suffer lesion; for<br>
the heart is, almost completely, in the healthy living body, enveloped<br>
in the lungs. So true is it that all the costal region (the asternal as<br>
well as the sternal) is a pulmonary enclosure, that any instrument which<br>
pierces intercostal space must wound the lung.<br>
<br>
As the sternal ribs degenerate into the "false" asternal or incomplete<br>
ribs from before, obliquely backward down to the last dorsal vertebra,<br>
so the thoracic space takes form. The lungs range through a much larger<br>
space, therefore, posteriorly than they do anteriorly.<br>
<br>
The form of the thorax, in relation to that of the abdomen, may be<br>
learned from the fact that a gunshot, which shall enter a little below<br>
N, Plate 1, and, after traversing the body transversely, shall pass out<br>
at a corresponding point at the opposite side, would open the thorax and<br>
the abdomen into a common cavity; for it would pierce the thorax at N,<br>
the arching diaphragm at the level of M, and thereat enter the belly;<br>
then it would enter the thorax again at P, and make exit below N,<br>
opposite. If a cutting instrument were passed horizontally from before<br>
backward, a little below M, it would first open the abdomen, then pierce<br>
the arching diaphragm, and pass into the thorax, opposite the ninth or<br>
eighth dorsal vertebra.<br>
<br>
The outward form or superficies masks in some degree the form of the<br>
interior. The width of the thorax above does not exceed the diameter<br>
between the points I I, of Plate 1, or the points W W, of Plate 2. If we<br>
make percussion directly from before backwards at any place external to<br>
I, Plate 1, we do not render the lung vibrative. The diameters between I<br>
I and N N, Plate 1, are not equal; and these measures will indicate the<br>
form of the thorax in the living body, between the shoulders above and<br>
the loins below.<br>
<br>
The position of the heart in the thorax varies somewhat with several<br>
bodies. The size of the heart, even in a state of perfect health, varies<br>
also in subjects of corresponding ages, a condition which is often<br>
mistaken for pathological. For the most part, its form occupies a space<br>
ranging from two or three lines right of the right side of the sternum<br>
to the middle of the shafts of the fifth and sixth ribs of the left<br>
side. In general, the length of the osseous sternum gives the exact<br>
perpendicular range of the heart, together with its great vessels.<br>
<br>
The aorta, C, Plates 1 and 2, is behind the upper half of the sternum,<br>
from which it is separated by the pericardium, D, Plate 1, the thin edge<br>
of the lung, and the mediastinal pleurae, U E, Plate 1, &amp;c. If the
heart<br>
be injected from the abdominal aorta, the aortal arch will flatten<br>
against the sternum. Pulmonary space would not be opened by a<br>
penetrating instrument passed into the root of the neck in the median<br>
line above the sternum, at L, Plate 1. But the apices of both lungs<br>
would be wounded if the same instrument entered deeply on either side of<br>
this median line at K K. An instrument which would pierce the sternum<br>
opposite the insertion of the second, third, or fourth costal cartilage,<br>
from H downwards, would transfix some part of the arch of the aorta, C,<br>
Plate 1. The same instrument, if pushed horizontally backward through<br>
the second, third, or fourth interspaces of the costal cartilages close<br>
to the sternum, would wound, on the right of the sternal line, the vena<br>
cava superior, G, Plate 1; on the left, the pulmonary artery, B, and<br>
the descending thoracic aorta. In the healthy living body, the thoracic<br>
sounds heard in percussion, or by means of the stethoscope, will vary<br>
according to the locality operated upon, in consequence of the variable<br>
thickness of those structures (muscular and osseous, &amp;c.,) which
invest<br>
the thoracic walls. Uniformity of sound must, owing to these facts, be<br>
as materially interrupted, as it certainly is, in consequence of the<br>
variable contents of the cavity. The variability of the healthy thoracic<br>
sounds will, therefore, be too often likely to be mistaken for that of<br>
disease, if we forget to admit these facts, as instanced in the former<br>
state. Considering the form of the thoracic space in reference to the<br>
general form of the trunk of the living body, I see reason to doubt<br>
whether the practitioner can by any boasted delicacy of manipulation,<br>
detect an abnormal state of the pulmonary organs by percussion, or the<br>
use of the stethoscope, applied at those regions which he terms<br>
coracoid, scapulary, subclavian, &amp;c., if the line of his
examination be<br>
directed from before backwards. The scapula, covered by thick carneous<br>
masses, does not lie in the living body directly upon the<br>
osseous-thorax, neither does the clavicle. As all antero-posterior<br>
examination in reference to the lungs external to the points, I I,<br>
between the shoulders cannot, in fact, concern the pulmonary organs, so<br>
it cannot be diagnostic of their state either in health or disease. The<br>
difficulties which oppose the practitioner's examination of the state of<br>
the thoracic contents are already numerous enough, independent of those<br>
which may arise from unanatomical investigation.<br>
