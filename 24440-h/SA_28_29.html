<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH<br>
LAYERS OF THE INGUINAL REGION IN CONNEXION WITH THOSE OF THE<br>
THIGH.<br>
<br>
The common integument or <span style="font-style: italic;">first layer</span>
of the inguino-femoral region being<br>
removed, we expose the superficial fascia constituting the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">second layer</span>.<br>
The connexion of this fascia with Poupart's ligament along the line C D,<br>
together with the facts, that corresponding with this line the fascia is<br>
devoid of adipous substance, and the integument thin and delicate,<br>
whilst above over the abdomen, and below over the upper part of the<br>
thigh, the meshes of the fascia are generally loaded with a considerable<br>
quantity of adipous tissue, will account for the permanency and<br>
distinctness of the fold of the groin. As this fold corresponds with<br>
Poupart's ligament, it is taken as a guide to distinguish between the<br>
inguinal and femoral forms of herniae.<br>
<br>
The general relations of the superficial fascia are well described by<br>
Camper in the following sentence: "Musculus obliquus igitur externus<br>
abdominis, qua parte carneus est, membrana quadam propria, quali omnes<br>
musculi, tegitur, quae sensim in aponeurosin mutata, ac cum tendineis<br>
hujus musculi partibus unita, externe ac anteriore parte abdomen tegit;<br>
finem vero nullibi habere perspicuum est, ad pubem enim miscet cellulosa<br>
membrana, cum ligamento penis in viris ac clitoridis in feminis,<br>
involucrum dat musculo cremasteri, ac aponeuroseos speciem musculis<br>
anterioribus femoris, qua glandulae inguinales, ac cruris vasa majora<br>
obteguntur." (Icones Herniarum.)<br>
<br>
Owing to the varied thickness of the adipous tissue contained in the<br>
superficial fascia at several regions of the same body, and at some<br>
corresponding regions of different individuals, it will be evident that<br>
the depth of the incision required to divide it, so as to expose<br>
subjacent structures, must vary accordingly. Where the superficial<br>
fascia, after encasing the cord, descends into the scrotum, it is also<br>
devoid of the fatty tissu.<br>
<br>
By the removal of the superficial fascia and glands we expose the<br>
aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, A <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a,</span> Pl. 28, (constituting<br>
t<span style="font-style: italic;">he third layer</span> of the groin,)
and also the fascia of the thigh, H L.<br>
These strong fibrous structures will be observed to hold still <span
 style="font-style: italic;">in situ</span><br>
the other parts, and to be the chief agents in determining the normal<br>
form of this region.<br>
<br>
The inguino-femoral region, as being the seat of hernial protrusions,<br>
may in this stage of the dissection be conveniently described as a space<br>
formed of two triangles--the one inguinal, the other femoral, placed<br>
base to base. The inguinal triangle may be drawn between the points, B<br>
C D, Pl. 28, while the femoral triangle may be marked by the points, C D<br>
N. The conjoined bases of these triangles correspond to Poupart's<br>
ligament along the line, C D. The inguinal varieties of herniae occur<br>
immediately above the line, C D, while the femoral varieties of herniae<br>
take place below this line. The herniae of the inguinal triangle are,<br>
therefore, distinguishable from those of the femoral triangle by a<br>
reference to the line, C D, or Poupart's ligament.<br>
<br>
The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle occupies the whole of<br>
that space which I have marked as the inguinal triangle, B C D, Pl. 28.<br>
The fleshy fibres of the muscle, A, after forming the lateral wall of<br>
the abdomen, descend to the level of C, the iliac spinous process, and<br>
here give off the inguinal part of their broad tendon, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>. The fibres of<br>
this part of the tendon descend obliquely downwards and forwards to<br>
become inserted at the median line of the abdomen into the linea alba, B<br>
D, as also into the symphysis and crista of the os pubis. The lower band<br>
of the fibres of this tendinous sheath--viz., that which is stretched<br>
between C, the iliac spine, and D, the crista pubis, is named Poupart's<br>
ligament; and this is strongly connected with H, the iliac portion of<br>
the fascia lata of the thigh.<br>
<br>
Poupart's ligament is not stretched tensely in a right line, like the<br>
string of a bow, between the points, C and D. With regard to these<br>
points it is lax, and curves down towards the thigh like the arc of a<br>
circle. The degree of tension which it manifests when the thigh is in<br>
the extended position is chiefly owing to its connexion with the fascia<br>
lata. If in this position of the limb we sever the connexion between the<br>
ligament and fascia, the former becomes relaxed in the same degree as it<br>
does when we flex the thigh upon the abdomen. The utmost degree of<br>
relaxation which can be given to Poupart's ligament is effected by<br>
flexing the thigh towards the abdomen, at the same time that we support<br>
the body forwards. This fact has its practical application in connexion<br>
with the reduction of herniae.<br>
<br>
Immediately above the middle of Poupart's ligament, at the point E, Pl.<br>
28, we observe the commencement of a separation taking place among the<br>
fibres of the aponeurosis. These divide into two bands, which, gradually<br>
widening from each other as they proceed inwards, become inserted, the<br>
upper one into the symphysis pubis, the lower into the spine and<br>
pectineal ridge of this bone. The lower band identifies itself with<br>
Poupart's ligament. The interval which is thus formed by the separation<br>
of these fibres assumes the appearance of an acute triangle, the apex of<br>
which is at E, and the base at D. But the outer end of this interval is<br>
rounded off by certain fibres which cross those of the bands at varying<br>
angles. At this place, the aponeurosis, thus constituted of fibres<br>
disposed crossways, is elongated into a canal, forming an envelope for<br>
the cord, K. This elongation is named the "external spermatic fascia,"<br>
and is continued over the cord as far as the testicle. In the female, a<br>
similar canal encloses the round ligament of the uterus. From the<br>
above-mentioned facts, it will appear that the so-called "external<br>
abdominal ring" does not exist as an aperture with defined margins<br>
formed in the tendon of the external oblique muscle. It is only when we<br>
divide the spermatic fascia upon the cord at K, that we form the<br>
external ring, and then it must be regarded as an artificial opening, as<br>
at D, Pl. 29.<br>
<br>
The part of the groin where the spermatic fascia is first derived from<br>
the aponeurosis, so as to envelope the cord, varies in several<br>
individuals; and thereupon depends, in great measure, the strength or<br>
weakness of the groin. In some cases, the cord becomes pendulous as far<br>
outwards as the point E, Pl. 28, which corresponds to the internal ring,<br>
thereby offering a direct passage for the hernial protrusion. In other<br>
instances, the two bands of the aponeurosis, known as the "pillars of<br>
the ring," together with the transverse fibres, or "intercolumnar<br>
fascia," firmly embrace and support the cord as far inwards as the point<br>
K, and by the oblique direction thus given to the cord in traversing the<br>
inguinal parietes, these parts are fortified against the occurrence of<br>
hernia. In Pl. 28, the cord, K, will be observed to drop over the lower<br>
band of fibres, ("external pillar of the ring,") and to have D, the<br>
crista pubis, on its inner side. In Pl. 29, the upper band of fibres<br>
("internal pillar of the ring") may be seen proceeding to its insertion<br>
into the symphysis pubis. When a hernial tumour protrudes at the<br>
situation K, it is invested, in the same manner as the cord, by the<br>
spermatic fascia, and holds in respect to the fibrous bands or pillars<br>
the same relations also as this part.<br>
<br>
After removing the tendon of the external oblique muscle, A <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,&nbsp;
Pl. 28,<br>
together with its spermatic elongation, E, we expose the internal<br>
oblique, F E, Pl. 29, and the cremaster, constituting the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">fourth</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">inguinal layer</span>. The fleshy
part of this muscle, F E, occupies a much<br>
greater extent of the inguinal region than does that of the external<br>
oblique. Whilst the fleshy fibres of the latter terminate on a level<br>
with C, the iliac spine, those of the internal oblique are continued<br>
down as far as the external abdominal ring, E D <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, and even protrude<br>
through this place in the form of a cremaster. The muscular fibres of<br>
the internal oblique terminate internally at the linea semilunaris, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g</span>;<br>
while Poupart's ligament, the spinous process and crest of the ilium,<br>
give origin to them externally. At the linea semilunaris, the tendon of<br>
the internal oblique is described as dividing into two layers, which<br>
passing, one before and the other behind the rectus abdominis, thus<br>
enclose this muscle in a sheath, after which they are inserted into the<br>
linea alba, G. The direction of the fibres of the inguinal portion of<br>
the muscle, F E, is obliquely downwards and forwards, and here they are<br>
firmly overlaid by the aponeurosis of the external oblique.<br>
<br>
The cremaster muscle manifests itself as being a part of the internal<br>
oblique, viewing this in its totality. Cloquet (Recherches anatomiques<br>
sur les Hernies de l'Abdomen) first demonstrated the correctness of this<br>
idea.<br>
<br>
The oblique and serial arrangement of the muscular fibres of the<br>
internal oblique, F, Pl. 29, is seen to be continued upon the spermatic<br>
cord by the fibres of the cremaster, E e. These fibres, like those of<br>
the lower border of the internal oblique, arise from the middle of<br>
Poupart's ligament, and after descending over the cord as far as the<br>
testicle in the form of a series of inverted loops, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">e</span>, again ascend to<br>
join the tendon of the internal oblique, by which they become inserted<br>
into the crest and pectineal ridge of the os pubis. The peculiar looping<br>
arrangement exhibited by the cremasteric fibres indicates the fact that<br>
the testicle, during its descent from the loins to the scrotum, carried<br>
with it a muscular covering, at the expense of the internal oblique<br>
muscle. The cremaster, therefore, is to be interpreted as a production<br>
of the internal oblique, just as the spermatic fascia is an elongation<br>
of the external oblique. The hernia, which follows the course of the<br>
spermatic vessels, must therefore necessarily become invested by<br>
cremasteric fibres.<br>
<br>
The fascia lata, H, Pl. 28, being strongly connected and continuous with<br>
Poupart's ligament along its inferior border, the boundary line, which<br>
Poupart's ligament is described as drawing between the abdomen and<br>
thigh, must be considered as merely an artificial one.<br>
<br>
In the upper region of the thigh the fascia lata is divided into two<br>
parts--viz., H, the iliac part, and L, the pubic. The iliac part, H,<br>
which is external, and occupying a higher plane than the pubic part, is<br>
attached to Poupart's ligament along its whole extent, from C to D, Pl.<br>
28; that is, from the anterior iliac spinous process to the crista<br>
pubis. From this latter point over the upper and inner part of the<br>
thigh, the iliac division of the fascia appears to terminate in an edge<br>
of crescentic shape, <span style="font-style: italic;">h;</span> but
this appearance is only given to it by our<br>
separating the superficial fascia with which it is, in the natural state<br>
of the parts, blended. The pubic part of the fascia, L, Pl. 28, which is<br>
much thinner than the iliac part, covers the pectineus muscle, and is<br>
attached to the crest and pectineal ridge of the os pubis, occupying a<br>
plane, therefore, below the iliac part, and in this way passes outwards<br>
beneath the sheath of the femoral vessels, K I, Pl. 29. These two<br>
divisions of the fascia lata, although separated above, are united and<br>
continuous on the same plane below. An interval is thus formed between<br>
them for the space of about two inches below the inner third of<br>
Poupart's ligament; and this interval is known as the "saphenous<br>
opening," L <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, Pl. 28.
Through this opening, the saphena vein, O, Pl.<br>
29, enters the femoral vein, I.<br>
<br>
From the foregoing remarks it will appear that no such aperture as that<br>
which is named "saphenous," and described as being shaped in the manner<br>
of L <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, Pl. 28, with its
"upper and lower cornua," and its "falciform<br>
process," or edge, <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, exists
naturally. Nor need we be surprised,<br>
therefore, that so accurate an observer as Soemmering (de Corporis<br>
Humani Fabrica) appears to have taken no notice of it.<br>
<br>
Whilst the pubic part of the fascia lata passes beneath the sheath of<br>
the femoral vessels, K I, Pl. 29, the iliac part, H <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, blends by its<br>
falciform margin with the superficial fascia, and also with N <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n,</span> the<br>
sheath of the femoral vessels. The so-called saphenous opening,<br>
therefore, is naturally masked by the superficial fascia; and this<br>
membrane being here perforated for the passage of the saphena vein, and<br>
its tributary branches, as also the efferent vessels of the lymphatic<br>
glands, is termed "cribriform."<br>
<br>
The femoral vessels, K I, contained in their proper sheath, lie<br>
immediately beneath the iliac part of the fascia lata, in that angle<br>
which is expressed by Poupart's ligament, along the line C D above; by<br>
the sartorius muscle in the line C M externally; and by a line drawn<br>
from D to N, corresponding to the pectineus muscle internally. The<br>
femoral vein, I, lies close to the outer margin of the saphenous<br>
opening. The artery, K, lies close to the outer side of the vein; and<br>
external to the artery is seen, L, the anterior crural nerve, sending<br>
off its superficial and deep branches.<br>
<br>
When a femoral hernia protrudes at the saphenous space L <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, Pl. 28, the<br>
dense falciform process, <span style="font-style: italic;">h,</span>
embraces its outer side, while the pubic<br>
portion of the fascia, L, lies beneath it. The cord, K, is placed on the<br>
inner side of the hernia; the cribriform fascia covers it; and the upper<br>
end of the saphena vein, M, passes beneath its lower border. The upper<br>
cornu, <span style="font-style: italic;">h,</span> Pl. 29, of the
falciform process would seem, by its situation,<br>
to be one of the parts which constrict a crural hernia. An inguinal<br>
hernia, which descends the cord, K, Pl. 28, provided it passes no<br>
further than the point indicated at K, and a crural hernia turning<br>
upwards from the saphenous interval over the cord at K, are very likely<br>
to present some difficulty in distinctive diagnosis.<br>
