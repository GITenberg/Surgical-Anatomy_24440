SURGICAL ANATOMY by JOSEPH MACLISE<br>
<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATE 27.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE SUPERFICIAL BLOODVESSELS ETC.<br>
OF THE INGUINO-FEMORAL REGION.<br>
<br>
Hernial protrusions are very liable to occur at the inguino-femoral<br>
region; and this fact has led the surgeon to study the anatomical<br>
relations of this part with more than ordinary care and patience. So<br>
minutely has he dissected every structure proper to this locality, and<br>
so closely has he investigated every possible condition of it as being<br>
the seat of hernial, that the only novelty which now remains to be<br>
sought for is that of a simplification of the facts, already known to be<br>
far too much obscured by an unwieldy nomenclature, and a useless detail<br>
of trifling evidence. And it would seem that nothing can more directly<br>
tend to this simplification, than that of viewing the inguinal and<br>
femoral regions, not separately, but as a relationary whole. For as both<br>
regions are blended together by structures which are common to both, so<br>
do the herniae which are described as being proper to either region,<br>
occur in such close connexion as at times to render it very difficult to<br>
distinguish between them.<br>
<br>
The human species is, of all others, most subject to hernial in the<br>
groin. The erect attitude of the human form, and the fact that many of<br>
its more powerful muscular efforts are performed in this posture, cause<br>
its more frequent liability to the accidents called abdominal herniae or<br>
ruptures.<br>
<br>
The viscera of the abdomen occupy this cavity completely, and indeed<br>
they naturally, at all times, subject the abdominal parietes to a state<br>
of constant pressure, as may be proved by their escape from the abdomen<br>
in cases of large wounds of this region. In the erect posture of the<br>
body this pressure is increased, for the viscera now gravitate and force<br>
downwards and forwards against the abdominal parietes. In addition to<br>
this gravitating force, another power impels the viscera from above<br>
downwards--namely, that of the muscles of the trunk, and the principal<br>
agent amongst these is the diaphragm. The lungs, again, expanding above<br>
the diaphragm, add also to the gravitation of the abdominal contents,<br>
and these, under the pressure thus accumulated, occasionally make an<br>
exit for themselves at the groins, which are the weakest and most<br>
depending parts of the abdomen.<br>
<br>
Herniae are variously named in accordance with the following<br>
circumstances--viz., the precise locality at which they occur--the size<br>
and form of the tumour--the time of life at which they happen. Sexual<br>
peculiarities do not serve to distinguish herniae, though it is true<br>
that the inguinal form, at the part D F, occurs more commonly in the<br>
male, whilst the crural form, at the opening E, happens more frequently<br>
in the female.<br>
<br>
The most common forms of herniae happen at those localities where the<br>
abdominal walls are traversed by the bloodvessels on their way to the<br>
outstanding organs, and where, in consequence, the walls of the abdomen<br>
have become weakened. It also happens, that at these very situations the<br>
visceral pressure is greatest whilst the body stands erect. These<br>
localities are, A, the umbilicus, a point characterized as having given<br>
passage (in the foetal state) to the umbilical vessels; D, the place<br>
where the spermatic vessels and duct pass from the abdomen to the<br>
testicle; and immediately beneath this, the crural arch, which gives<br>
exit to the crural vessels. Herniae may happen at other localities, such<br>
as at the thyroid aperture, which transmits the thyroid vessels; and at<br>
the greater sacrosciatic notch, through which the gluteal vessels pass;<br>
and all regions of the abdominal walls may give exit to intestinal<br>
protrusion in consequence of malformations, disease, or injury. But as<br>
the more frequent varieties of herniae are those which traverse the<br>
localities, A, D, E, and as these, fortunately, are the most manageable<br>
under the care of the surgical anatomist, we proceed to examine the<br>
structures concerned in their occurrence.<br>
<br>
A direct opening from within outwards does not exist in the walls of the<br>
abdomen; and anatomy demonstrates to us the fact, that where the<br>
spermatic cord, D F, and the femoral vessels, pass from the abdomen to<br>
the external parts, they carry with them a covering of the several<br>
layers of structures, both muscular and membranous, which they encounter<br>
in their passage. The inguinal and crural forms of herniae which follow<br>
the passages made by the spermatic cord, and the crural vessels, must<br>
necessarily carry with them the like investments, and these are what<br>
constitute the coverings of the herniae themselves.<br>
<br>
The groin in its undissected state is marked by certain elevations and<br>
depressions which indicate the general relations of the subcutaneous<br>
parts. The abdomen is separated from the thigh by an undulating grooved<br>
line, extending from C*, the point of the iliac bone, to B, the<br>
symphysis pubis This line or fold of the groin coincides exactly with<br>
the situation of that fibrous band of the external oblique muscle named<br>
Poupart's ligament. From below the middle of this abdomino-femoral<br>
groove, C B, another curved line, D, <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>,
springs, and courses obliquely,<br>
inwards and downwards, between the upper part of the thigh and the<br>
pubis, to terminate in the scrotum. The external border of this line<br>
indicates the course of the spermatic cord, D F, which can be readily<br>
felt beneath the skin. In all subjects, however gross or emaciated they<br>
may happen to be, these two lines are readily distinguishable, and as<br>
they bear relations to the several kinds of rupture taking place in<br>
these parts, the surgeon should consider them with keen regard. A<br>
comparison of the two sides of the figure, PLATE 27, will show that the<br>
spermatic cord, D F, and Poupart's ligament, C B, determine the shape of<br>
the inguino-femoral region. When the integument with the subcutaneous<br>
adipose tissue is removed from the inguino-femoral region, we expose<br>
that common investing membrane called the superficial fascia. This<br>
fascia, <span style="font-style: italic;">a a a</span>, stretches over
the lower part of the abdomen and the<br>
upper part of the thigh. It becomes intimately attached to Poupart's<br>
ligament along the ilio-pubic line, C B; it invests the spermatic cord,<br>
as shown at <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, and descends
into the scrotum, so as to encase this part.<br>
Where this superficial fascia overlies the saphenous opening, E, of the<br>
fascia lata, it assumes a "cribriform" character, owing to its being<br>
pierced by numerous lymphatic vessels and some veins. As this<br>
superficial fascia invests all parts of the inguino-femoral region, as<br>
it forms an envelope for the spermatic cord, D F, and sheathes over the<br>
saphenous opening, E, it must follow of course that wherever the hernial<br>
protrusion takes place in this region, whether at D, or F, or E, or<br>
adjacent parts, this membrane forms the external subcutaneous covering<br>
of the bowel.<br>
<br>
There is another circumstance respecting the form and attachments of the<br>
superficial fascia, which, in a pathological point of view, is worthy of<br>
notice--viz., that owing to the fact of its enveloping the scrotum,<br>
penis, spermatic cord, and abdominal parietes, whilst it becomes firmly<br>
attached to Poupart's ligament along the abdomino-femoral fold, B C, it<br>
isolates these parts, in some degree, from the thigh; and when urine<br>
happens to be from any cause extravasated through this abdominal-scrotal<br>
bag of the superficial fascia, the thighs do not in general participate<br>
in the inflammation superinduced upon such accident.<br>
<br>
The spermatic cord, D, emerges from the abdomen and becomes definable<br>
through the fibres of the sheathing tendon of the external oblique<br>
muscle, H, at a point midway between the extremities of the ilio-pubic<br>
line or fold. In some cases, this place, whereat the cord first<br>
manifests itself in the groin, lies nearer the pubic symphysis; but<br>
however much it may vary in this particular, we may safely regard the<br>
femoro-pubic fold, D, <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, as
containing the cord, and also that the place<br>
where this fold meets the iliopubic line, C B, at the point D, marks the<br>
exit of the cord from the abdomen.<br>
<br>
The spermatic cord does not actually pierce the sheathing tendon of the<br>
external oblique muscle at the point D, and there does not, in fact,<br>
exist naturally such an opening as the "external abdominal ring," for<br>
the cord carries with it a production of the tendon of the external<br>
oblique muscle, and this has been named by surgical anatomists the<br>
"intercolumnar fascia," [Footnote] the "spermatic fascia." The fibres of<br>
this spermatic fascia are seen at D F, crossing the cord obliquely, and<br>
encasing it. This covering of the cord lies beneath the spermatic<br>
envelope formed by, <span style="font-style: italic;">a b,</span> the
superficial fascia; and when a hernial<br>
protrusion descends through the cord, both these investing membranes<br>
form the two outermost envelopes for the intestine in its new and<br>
abnormal situation.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: On referring to the works of Sir Astley Cooper, Hesselbach,<br>
Scarpa, and, others, I find attempts made to establish a distinction<br>
between what is called the "intercolumnar fascia" and the "spermatic<br>
fascia," and just as if these were structures separable from each other<br>
or from the aponeurotic sheath of the external oblique muscle. I find,<br>
in like manner, in these and other works, a tediously-laboured account<br>
of the superficial fascia, as being divisible into two layers of<br>
membrane, and that this has given rise to considerable difference of<br>
opinion as to whether or not we should regard the deeper layer as being<br>
a production of the fascia lata, ascending from the thigh to the<br>
abdomen, or rather of the membrane of the abdomen descending to the<br>
thigh, &amp;c. These and such like considerations I omit to discuss
here;<br>
for, with all proper deference to the high authority of the authors<br>
cited, I dare to maintain, that, in a practical point of view, they arc<br>
absolutely of no moment, and in a purely scientific view, they are, so<br>
far as regards the substance of the truth which they would reveal,<br>
wholly beneath the notice of the rational mind. The practitioner who<br>
would arm his judgment with the knowledge of a broad fact or principle,<br>
should not allow his serious attention to be diverted by a pursuit after<br>
any such useless and trifling details, for not only are they unallied to<br>
the stern requirements of surgical skill, but they serve to degrade it<br>
from the rank and roll of the sciences. Whilst operating for the<br>
reduction of inguinal hernia by the "taxis" or the bistoury, who is<br>
there that feels anxiety concerning the origin or the distinctiveness of<br>
the "spermatic fascia?" Or, knowing it to be present, who concerns<br>
himself about the better propriety of naming it "tunica vaginalis<br>
communis," "tunique fibreuse du cordon spermatique," "fascia<br>
cremasterica," or "tunica aponeurotica?"]<br>
<br>
The close relations which the cord, D F, bears to the saphenous opening,<br>
E, of the fascia lata, should be closely considered, forasmuch as when<br>
an oblique inguinal hernia descends from D to F, it approaches the<br>
situation of the saphenous opening, E, which is the seat of the femoral<br>
or crural hernia, and both varieties of hernia may hence be confounded.<br>
But with a moderate degree of judgment, based upon the habit of<br>
referring the anatomy to the surface, such error may always be avoided.<br>
This important subject shall be more fully treated of further on.<br>
<br>
The superficial bloodvessels of the inguino-femoral region are,<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> e e</span>,<br>
the saphenous vein, which, ascending from the inner side of the leg and<br>
thigh, pierces the saphenous opening, E, to unite with the femoral vein.<br>
The saphenous vein, previously to entering the saphenous opening,<br>
receives the epigastric vein, <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>,
the external circumflex ilii vein, <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>,<br>
and another venous branch, <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>,
coming from the fore part of the thigh. In<br>
the living body the course of the distended saphenous vein may be traced<br>
beneath the skin, and easily avoided in surgical operations upon the<br>
parts contained in this region. Small branches of the femoral artery<br>
pierce the fascia lata, and accompany these superficial veins. Both<br>
these orders of vessels are generally divided in the operation required<br>
for the reduction of either the inguinal or the femoral strangulated<br>
hernia; but they are, for the most part, unimportant in size. Some<br>
branches of nerves, such as, <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span>,
the external cutaneous, which is given<br>
off from the lumbar nerves, and, <span style="font-style: italic;">f, </span>the
middle cutaneous, which is<br>
derived from the crural nerve, pierce the fascia lata, and appear upon<br>
the external side and middle of the thigh.<br>
<br>
Numerous lymphatic glands occupy the inguino-femoral region; these can<br>
be felt, lying subcutaneous, even in the undissected state of the parts.<br>
These glands form two principal groups, one of which, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c,</span> lies along the<br>
middle of the inguinal fold, C B; the other, G <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g</span>, lies scattered in the<br>
neighbourhood of the saphenous opening. The former group receive the<br>
lymphatic vessels of the generative organs; and the glands of which it<br>
is composed are those which suppurate in, syphilitic or other affections<br>
of these parts.<br>
<br>
The general relations which the larger vessels of the inguino-femoral<br>
region bear to each other and to the superficies, may be referred to in<br>
PLATE 27, with practical advantage. The umbilicus, A, indicates pretty<br>
generally the level at which the aorta bifurcates on the forepart of the<br>
lumbar vertebrae. In the erect, and even in the recumbent posture, the<br>
aorta may (especially in emaciated subjects) be felt pulsating under the<br>
pressure of the hand; for the vertebrae bear forward the vessel to a<br>
level nearly equal with, C C, the anterior superior spinous processes of<br>
the iliac bones. If a gunshot were to pass through the abdomen,<br>
transversely, from these points, and through B, it would penetrate the<br>
aorta at its bifurcation. The line A B coincides with the linea alba.<br>
The oblique lines, A D, A D,* indicate the course of the iliac vessels.<br>
The point D marks the situation where the spermatic vessels enter the<br>
abdomen; and also where the epigastric artery is given off from the<br>
external iliac. The most convenient line of incision that can be made<br>
for reaching the situation of either of the iliac arteries, is that<br>
which ranges from C, the iliac spine, to D, the point where the<br>
spermatic cord enters the abdomen. The direct line drawn between D and G<br>
marks the course of the femoral artery, and this ranges along the outer<br>
border, E, of the saphenous opening.<br>
