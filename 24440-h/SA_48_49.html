COMMENTARY ON PLATES 48 &amp; 49.<br>
<br>
THE RELATIVE ANATOMY OF THE MALE PELVIC ORGANS.<br>
<br>
As the abdomen and pelvis form one general cavity, the organs contained<br>
in both regions are thereby intimately related. The viscera of the<br>
abdomen completely fill this region, and transmit to the pelvic organs<br>
all the impressions made upon them by the diaphragm and abdominal walls.<br>
The expansion of the lungs, the descent of the diaphragm, and the<br>
contraction of the abdominal muscles, cause the abdominal viscera to<br>
descend and compress the pelvic organs; and at the same time the muscles<br>
occupying the pelvic outlet, becoming relaxed or contracted, allow the<br>
perinaeum to be protruded or sustained voluntarily according to the<br>
requirements. Thus it is that the force originated in the muscular<br>
parietes of the thorax and abdomen is, while opposed by the counterforce<br>
of the perinaeal muscles, brought so to bear upon the pelvic organs as<br>
to become the principal means whereby the contents of these are<br>
evacuated. The abdominal muscles are, during this act, the antagonists<br>
of the diaphragm, while the muscles which guard the pelvic outlet become<br>
at the time the antagonists of both. As the pelvic organs appear<br>
therefore to be little more than passive recipients of their contents,<br>
the <span style="font-style: italic;">voluntary </span>processes of
defecation and micturition may with more<br>
correctness be said to be performed rather for them than by them. The<br>
relations which they bear to the abdomen and its viscera, and their<br>
dependence upon these relations for the due performance of the processes<br>
in which they serve, are sufficiently explained by pathological facts.<br>
The same system of muscles comprising those of the thorax, abdomen and<br>
perinaeum, performs consentaneously the acts of respiration, vomiting,<br>
defecation and micturition. When the spinal cord suffers injury above<br>
the origin of the phrenic nerve, immediate death supervenes, owing to a<br>
cessation of the respiratory act. Considering, however, the effect of<br>
such an injury upon the pelvic organs alone, these may be regarded as<br>
being absolutely excluded from the pale of voluntary influence in<br>
consequence of the paralysis of the diaphragm, the abdominal and<br>
perinaeal muscles. The expulsory power over the bladder and rectum being<br>
due to the opposing actions of these muscles above and below, if the<br>
cord be injured in the neck below the origin of the phrenic nerve, the<br>
inferior muscles becoming paralysed, the antagonism of muscular forces<br>
is thereby interrupted, and the pelvic organs are, under such<br>
circumstances, equally withdrawn from the sphere of volition. The<br>
antagonism of the abdominal muscles to the diaphragm being necessary, in<br>
order that the pelvic viscera may be acted upon, if the cord be injured<br>
in the lower dorsal region, so as to paralyse the abdominal walls and<br>
the perinaeal muscles, the downward pressure of the diaphragm alone<br>
could not evacuate the pelvic organs voluntarily, for the abdominal<br>
muscles are now incapable of deflecting the line of force backwards and<br>
downwards through the pelvic axis; and the perinaeal muscles being also<br>
unable to act in agreement, the contents of the viscera pass<br>
involuntarily. Again, as the muscular apparatus which occupies the<br>
pelvic outlet acts antagonistic to the abdomen and thorax, when by an<br>
injury to the cord in the sacral spine the perinaeal apparatus alone<br>
becomes paralysed, its relaxation allows the thoracic and abdominal<br>
force to evacuate the pelvic organs involuntarily. It would appear,<br>
therefore, that the term "paralysis" of the bladder or rectum, when<br>
following spinal injuries, &amp;c. &amp;c. means, or should mean, only a<br>
paralytic state of the abdomino-pelvic muscular apparatus, entirely or<br>
in part. For, in fact, neither the bladder nor rectum ever acts<br>
voluntarily <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> any more
than the stomach does, and therefore the<br>
name "detrusor" urinae, as applied to the muscular coat investing the<br>
bladder, is as much a misnomer (if it be meant that the act of voiding<br>
the organ at will be dependent upon it) as would be the name "detrusor"<br>
applied to the muscular coat of the stomach, under the meaning that this<br>
were the agent in the spasmodic effort of vomiting.<br>
<br>
The urinary bladder, G, Plate 49, (in the adult body,) occupies the true<br>
pelvic region when the organ is collapsed, or only partly distended. It<br>
is situated behind the pubic symphysis and in front of the rectum,<br>
C,--the latter lies between it and the sacrum, A. In early infancy, when<br>
the pelvis is comparatively small, the bladder is situated in the<br>
hypogastric region, with its summit pointing towards the umbilicus; as<br>
the bladder varies in shape, according to whether it be empty or full,<br>
its relations to neighbouring parts, especially to those in connexion<br>
with its summit, vary also considerably. When empty, the back and upper<br>
surface of the bladder collapse against its forepart, and in this state<br>
the organ lies flattened against the pubic symphysis. Whether the<br>
bladder be distended or not, the small intestines lie in contact with<br>
its upper surface, and compress it in the manner of a soft elastic<br>
cushion. When distended largely, its summit is raised above the pubic<br>
symphysis, the small intestines having yielded place to it, and in this<br>
state it can be felt by the hand laid upon the hypogastrium.<br>
<br>
The shape of the bladder varies in different individuals. In some it is<br>
rounded, in others pyriform, in others peaked towards its summit. Its<br>
capacity varies also considerably at different ages and in different<br>
sexes. When distended, its long axis will be found to coincide with a<br>
line passing from a point midway between the navel and pubes to the<br>
point of the coccyx, the obliquity of this direction being greatest when<br>
the body is in the erect posture, for the intestines now gravitate upon<br>
it. When the body is recumbent, the bladder recedes somewhat from the<br>
pubes, and as the intestines do not now press upon it from above, it<br>
allows of being distended to a much greater degree without causing<br>
uneasiness, and a desire to void its contents.<br>
<br>
The manner in which the bladder is connected to neighbouring parts is<br>
such as to admit of its full distension. Its summit, back, and upper<br>
sides are free and covered by the elastic peritonaeum, whilst its front,<br>
lower sides, and base are adherent to adjacent parts, and divested of<br>
the serous membrane. On tracing the peritonaeum from the front wall of<br>
the abdomen to its point of reflexion over the summit of the bladder, we<br>
find the membrane to be in this part so loosely adherent, that the<br>
bladder when much distended, raises the peritonaeum above the level of<br>
the upper margin of the pubic symphysis. In this state the organ may be<br>
punctured immediately above the pubic symphysis without endangering the<br>
serous sac. When the bladder is collapsed, the peritonaeum follows its<br>
summit below the level of the pubes, and in this position of the organ<br>
such an operation would be inadmissible, if indeed the necessity for it<br>
can now be conceived.<br>
<br>
By removing the os innominatum, A D, Plate 48, together with the<br>
internal obturator, and levator ani muscles, which arise from its inner<br>
side, we obtain a lateral view, Plate 49, of the pelvic viscera, and of<br>
the vessels &amp;c. connected with them. Those parts of the bladder, G,
and<br>
the rectum, C, which are invested by the peritonaeum, are also now fully<br>
displayed. On tracing this membrane from before backwards, over the<br>
summit of the bladder, G, we find it descending deeply upon the<br>
posterior surface of the organ, before it becomes reflected so as to<br>
ascend over the forepart of the rectum. This duplicature of the serous<br>
membrane, H H, is named the recto-vesical pouch, and it is required to<br>
ascertain with all the exactness possible the level to which it<br>
descends, so as to avoid it in the operation of puncturing the bladder<br>
through the rectum. The serous pouch descends lower in some bodies than<br>
in others; but in all there exists a space, of greater or less<br>
dimensions, between it and the prostate, V, whereat the base of the<br>
bladder is in direct apposition with the rectum, W, the serous membrane<br>
not intervening.<br>
<br>
When the peritonaeum is traced from one iliac fossa to the other, we<br>
find it sinking deeply into the hollow of the pelvis behind the bladder,<br>
so as to form the sides of the recto-vesical pouch; but when traced over<br>
the summit of the bladder, this organ is seen to have the membrane<br>
reflected upon it, almost immediately below the pelvic brim. At the<br>
situations where the peritonaeum becomes reflected in front, laterally,<br>
and behind, upon the sides of the bladder, the membrane is thrown into<br>
folds, which are named "false ligaments." The pelvic fascia, in being<br>
reflected to the bladder from the front and sides of the pelvis, at a<br>
lower level than that of the peritonaeum, forms the "true ligaments." In<br>
addition to these ligaments, which serve to keep the base and front of<br>
the bladder fixed in the pelvis, other structures, such as the ureters,<br>
K, the vasa deferentia, I, the hypogastric cords, the urachus, and the<br>
bloodvessels, embrace the organ in various directions, and act as<br>
bridles, to limit its expansion more or less in all directions, but<br>
least so towards its summit, which is always comparatively free.<br>
<br>
The neck and outlet of the bladder, V, are situated at the anterior part<br>
of its base, and point towards the subpubic space. The prostate gland,<br>
V, surrounds its neck, and occupies a position behind and below the<br>
pubic arch, D, and in front of the rectum, W. The gland, V, being of a<br>
rounded form and dense structure, can be felt in this situation by the<br>
finger, passed upwards through the bowel. The prostate is suspended from<br>
the back of the pubic arch by the anterior true ligament of the bladder,<br>
and at its forepart, where the membranous portion of the urethra<br>
commences, this passes through the deep perinaeal fascia, X. The<br>
anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle embrace the prostate on both<br>
its sides. Behind the base of the prostate, the ureter, K, is seen to<br>
enter the coats of the bladder obliquely, whilst the vas deferens, I,<br>
joined by the vesicula seminalis, L, penetrates the substance of the<br>
prostate, V, at its lower and back part, which lies in apposition with<br>
the rectum.<br>
<br>
The rectum, W C, at its middle and upper parts, occupies the hollow of<br>
the sacrum, A Q, and is behind the bladder. The lower third of the<br>
rectum, W, not being covered by the peritonaeum, is that part on which<br>
the various surgical operations are performed. At its upper<br>
three-fifths, the rectum describes a curve corresponding to that of the<br>
sacrum; and if the bladder be full, its convex back part presses the<br>
bowel against the bone, causing its curve to be greater than if the<br>
bladder were empty and collapsed. This fact requires to be borne in<br>
mind, for, in order to introduce a bougie, or to allow a large injection<br>
to pass with freedom into the bowel, the bladder should be first<br>
evacuated. The coccygeal bones, Q, continuing in the curve of the<br>
sacrum, bear the rectum, W, forwards against the base of the bladder,<br>
and give to this part a degree of obliquity upwards and backwards, in<br>
respect to the perinaeum and anus. From the point where the prostate, V,<br>
lies in contact with the rectum, W, this latter curves downwards, and<br>
slightly backwards, to the anus, P. The prostate is situated at a<br>
distance of about an inch and a half or two inches from the anus--the<br>
distance varying according to whether the bladder and bowel be distended<br>
or not. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: The distance between any two given parts is found to vary in<br>
different cases. "In subjects of an advanced age," Mr. Stanley remarks,<br>
"a deep perinaeum, as it is termed, is frequently met with. This may be<br>
occasioned either by an unusual quantity of fat in the perinaeum, or by<br>
an enlarged prostate, or by the dilatation of that part of the rectum<br>
which is contiguous to the prostate and bladder. Under either of these<br>
circumstances, the prostate and bladder become situated higher in the<br>
pelvis than naturally, and consequently at a greater distance from the<br>
perinaeum."--<span style="font-style: italic;">On the Lateral Operation
of Lithotomy</span>.]<br>
<br>
The arteries of the bladder are derived from the branches of the<br>
internal iliac, S. The rectum receives its arteries from the inferior<br>
mesenteric and pudic. The veins which course upwards from the rectum are<br>
large and numerous, and devoid of valves. When these veins become<br>
varicose, owing to a stagnation of their circulation, produced from<br>
whatever cause, the bowel is liable to be affected with haemorrhoids or<br>
to assume a haemorrhagic tendency.<br>
<br>
The pudic artery, S <span style="font-style: italic;">s,</span> is a
branch of the internal iliac. It passes from<br>
the pelvis by the great sciatic foramen, below the pyriformis muscle,<br>
and in company with the sciatic artery. The pudic artery and vein wind<br>
around the spine, E, of the ischium, where they are joined by the pudic<br>
nerve, derived from, T, the sacral plexus. The artery, in company with<br>
the nerve and vein, re-enters the pelvis by the small sciatic foramen,<br>
and gets under cover of a dense fibrous membrane (obturator fascia),<br>
between which and the obturator muscle, it courses obliquely downwards<br>
and forwards to the forepart of the perinaeum. At the place where the<br>
vessel re-enters the pelvis, it lies removed at an interval of an inch<br>
and a half from the perinaeum, but becomes more superficial as it<br>
approaches the subpubic space, N. The levator ani muscle separates the<br>
pudic vessels and nerves from the sides of the rectum and bladder. The<br>
principal branches given off from the pudic artery of either side, are<br>
(1st), the inferior hemorrhoidal, to supply the lower end of the rectum;<br>
(2nd), the transverse and superficial perinaeal; (3rd), the artery of<br>
the bulb; (4th), that which enters the corpus cavernosum of the penis,<br>
N; and (5th), the dorsal artery of the penis. [Footnote] The branches<br>
given off from the pudic nerve correspond in number and place to those<br>
of the artery. Having now considered the relations of the pelvic organs<br>
in a lateral view, we are better prepared to understand these relations<br>
when seen at their perinaeal aspect.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: The pudic artery, or some one of its branches, occasionally<br>
undergoes marked deviations from the ordinary course. In Mr. Quain's<br>
work, ("Anatomy of the Arteries,") a case is represented in which the<br>
artery of the bulb arose from the pudic as far back as the tuber ischii,<br>
and crossed the line of incision made in the lateral operation of<br>
lithotomy. In another figure is seen a vessel ("accessory pudic"),<br>
which, passing between the base of the bladder and the levator ani<br>
muscle, crosses in contact with the left lobe of the prostate.]<br>
