THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE MALE BLADDER AND URETHRA.--<br>
LATERAL AND BILATERAL LITHOTOMY COMPARED.<br>
<br>
Having examined the surgical relations of the bladder and adjacent<br>
structures, in reference to the lateral operation of lithotomy, it<br>
remains to reconsider these same parts as they are concerned in the<br>
bilateral operation and in catheterism.<br>
<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 54, represents the normal relations of the more important<br>
parts concerned in lithotomy as performed at the perinaeal region. The<br>
median line, AA, drawn from the symphysis pubis above, to the point of<br>
the coccyx below, is seen to traverse vertically the centres of the<br>
urethra, the prostate, the base of the bladder, the anus, and the<br>
rectum. These several parts are situated at different depths from the<br>
perinaeal surface. The bulb of the urethra and the lower end of the<br>
bowel are on the same plane comparatively superficial. The prostate lies<br>
between these two parts, and on a plane deeper than they. The base of<br>
the bladder is still more deeply situated than the prostate; and hence<br>
it is that the end of the bowel is allowed to advance so near the<br>
pendent bulb, that those parts are in a great measure concealed by<br>
these. As the apex of the prostate lies an inch (more or less) deeper<br>
than the bulb, so the direction of the membranous urethra, which<br>
intervenes between the two, is according to the axis of the pelvic<br>
outlet; the prostatic end of the membranous urethra being deeper than<br>
the part near the bulb. The scalpel of the lithotomist, guided by the<br>
staff in this part of the urethra, is made to enter the neck of the<br>
bladder <span style="font-style: italic;">deeply</span> in the same
direction. On comparing the course of the<br>
pudic arteries with the median line, A A, we find that they are removed<br>
from it at a wider interval below than above; and also that where the<br>
vessels first enter the perinaeal space, winding around the spines of<br>
the ischia, they are much deeper in this situation (on a level with the<br>
base of the bladder) than they are when arrived opposite the bulb of the<br>
urethra. The transverse line B B, drawn in front of the anus from one<br>
tuber ischii to the other, is seen to divide the perinaeum into the<br>
anterior and posterior spaces, and to intersect at right angles the<br>
median line A A. In the same way the line B B divides transversely both<br>
pudic arteries, the front of the bowel, the base of the prostate, and<br>
the sides of the neck of the bladder. Lateral lithotomy is performed in<br>
reference to the line A A; the bilateral operation in regard to the line<br>
B B. In order to avoid the bulb and rectum at the median line, and the<br>
pudic artery at the outer side of the perinaeum, the lateral incisions<br>
are made obliquely in the direction of the lines CD. In the bilateral<br>
operation the incision necessary to avoid the bulb of the urethra in<br>
front, the rectum behind, and the pudic arteries laterally, is required<br>
to be made of a semicircular form, corresponding with the forepart of<br>
the bowel; the cornua of the incision being directed behind. In the<br>
lateral operation, the incision C through the integument, crosses at an<br>
acute angle the deeper incision D, which divides the neck of the<br>
bladder, the prostate, &amp;c. The left lobe of the prostate is divided<br>
obliquely in the lateral operation; both lobes transversely in the<br>
bilateral.<br>

<br>
<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 54.--If the artery of the bulb happen to arise from the<br>
pudic opposite the tuber ischii, or if the inferior hemorrhoidal<br>
arteries be larger than usual, these vessels crossing the lines of<br>
incision in both operations will be divided. If the superficial lateral<br>
incision C, Fig. 1, be made too deeply at its forepart, the artery of<br>
the bulb, even when in its usual place, will be wounded; and if the deep<br>
lateral incision D be carried too far outwards, the trunk of the pudic<br>
artery will be severed. These accidents are incidental in the bilateral<br>
operation also, in performing which it should be remembered that the<br>
bulb is in some instances so large and pendulous, as to lie in contact<br>
with the front of the rectum.<br>
<br>

Plate 54, Figure 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 55.--When the pudic artery crosses in contact with the<br>
prostate, F, it must inevitably be divided in either mode of operation.<br>
Judging from the shape of the prostate, I am of opinion that this part,<br>
whether incised transversely in the line B B, or laterally in the line<br>
D, will exhibit a wound in the neck of the bladder of equal dimensions.<br>
When the calculus is large, it is recommended to divide the neck of the<br>
bladder by an incision, combined of the transverse and the lateral. The<br>
advantages gained by such a combination are, that while the surface of<br>
the section made in the line D is increased by "notching" the right lobe<br>
of the prostate in the direction of the line B, the sides of both<br>
sections are thereby rendered more readily separable, so as to suit with<br>
the rounded form of the calculus to be extracted. These remarks are<br>
equally applicable as to the mode in which the superficial perinaeal<br>
incision should be made under the like necessity. If the prostate be<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">wholly</span> divided in either line
of section, the pelvic fascia adhering to<br>
the base of this body will be equally subject to danger. By incising the<br>
prostate transversely, B B, the seminal ducts, G H, which enter the base<br>
of this body, are likewise divided; but by the simple lateral incision D<br>
being made through the forepart of the left lobe, F, these ducts will<br>
escape injury. [Footnote] On the whole, therefore, the lateral operation<br>
appears preferable to the bilateral one.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: As to the mode in which the superficial and deep incisions in<br>
lateral lithotomy should be made, a very eminent operating surgeon<br>
remarks--"a free incision of the skin I consider a most important<br>
feature in the operation; but beyond this the application of the knife<br>
should, in my opinion, be extremely limited. In so far as I can<br>
perceive, there should be no hesitation in cutting any part of the gland<br>
which seems to offer resistance, with the exception, perhaps, of its<br>
under surface, where the position of the seminal ducts, and other<br>
circumstances, should deter the surgeon from using a cutting<br>
instrument."--Wm. Fergusson, <span style="font-style: italic;">Practical
Surgery</span>, 3d Am. Ed., p. 610.]<br>

Plate 55--Figure 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 55.--The muscular structures surrounding the membranous<br>
urethra and the neck of the bladder, and which are divided in lithotomy,<br>
have been examined from time to time by anatomists with more than<br>
ordinary painstaking, owing to the circumstance that they are found<br>
occasionally to offer, by spasmodic contraction, an obstacle to the<br>
passage of the catheter along the urethral canal. These muscles do not<br>
appear to exist in all subjects alike. In some, they are altogether<br>
wanting; in others, a few of them only appear; in others, they seem to<br>
be not naturally separable from the larger muscles which are always<br>
present. Hence it is that the opinions of anatomists respecting their<br>
form, character, and even their actual existence, are so conflicting,<br>
not only against each other, but against nature. In Fig. 2, Plate 55, I<br>
have summed together all the facts recorded concerning them, [Footnote]<br>
and on comparing these facts with what I have myself observed, the<br>
muscles seem to me to assume originally the form and relative position<br>
of the parts B C D E F viewed in their totality. Each of these parts of<br>
muscular structure arises from the ischio-pubic ramus, and is inserted<br>
at the median line A A. They appear to me, therefore, to be muscles of<br>
the same category, which, if all were present, would assume the serial<br>
order of B C D E F. When one or more of them are omitted from the<br>
series, there occurs anatomical variety, which of course occasions<br>
variety in opinion, fruitless though never ending. By that<br>
interpretation of the parts which I here venture to offer, and to which<br>
I am guided by considerations of a higher law of formation, I encompass<br>
and bind together, as with a belt, all the dismembered parts of variety,<br>
and of these I construct a uniform whole. Forms become, when not viewed<br>
under comparison, as meaningless hieroglyphics, as the algebraic symbols<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">a + c - d </span>= 11 are when the
mind is devoid of the power of calculation.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: The part C is that alone described by Santorini, who named it<br>
"elevator urethrae," as passing beneath the urethra. The part B is that<br>
first observed and described by Mr. Guthrie as passing above the<br>
urethra. The part F represents the well-known "transversalis perinaei,"<br>
between which and the part C there occasionally appears the part E,<br>
supposed to be the "transversalis alter" of Albinus, and also the part<br>
D, which is the "ischio bulbosus" of Cruveilhier. It is possible that I<br>
may not have given one or other of these parts its proper name, but this<br>
will not affect their anatomy.]<br>

Plate 55--Figure 2<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 3, Plate 55.--The membranous urethra A is also in some instances<br>
embraced by two symmetrical fasciculi of muscular fibres B B, which<br>
arising from the posterior and lower part of the symphysis pubis,<br>
descend on either side of the canal and join beneath it. The muscles B<br>
C, Fig. 2, Plate 55, are between the two layers of the deep perinaeal<br>
fascia, while the muscle B B, Fig. 3, Plate 55, lies like the forepart<br>
of the levator ani, C C, behind this structure and between it and the<br>
anterior ligaments of the bladder. [Footnote] As to the interpretation<br>
of the muscle, I, myself, am inclined to believe that it is simply a<br>
part of the levator ani, and for these reasons--1st, it arises from the<br>
pubic symphysis, and is inserted into the perinaeal median line with the<br>
levator ani; 2nd, the fibres of both muscles overlie the forepart of the<br>
prostate, and present the same arrangement in parallel order; 3rd, the<br>
one is not naturally separable from the other.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: This is the muscle, B B, which is described by Santorini as<br>
the "levator prostatae;" by Winslow as "le prostatique superieur;" by<br>
Wilson as the "pubo-urethrales;" by Muller as not existing; by Mr.<br>
Guthrie as forming (when existing), with the parts B C, Fig. 2, Plate<br>
55, his "compressor isthmi urethrae;" and by M. Cruveilhier as being<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">part of the levator ani muscle</span>.
"As in one case," (observes Mr. Quain,)<br>
"I myself saw a few vertical muscular fibres connected with the<br>
transverse compressor, it has been thought best to retain the muscle in<br>
the text."--Dr. Quain's <span style="font-style: italic;">Anat.</span>,

Plate 55--Figure 3<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 56, represents by section the natural forms of the urethra<br>
and bladder. The general direction of the urethra measured during its<br>
relaxed state from the vesical orifice to the glans is usually described<br>
as having the form of the letter S laid procumbent to the right side<br>
[capital S rotated 90 degrees right] or to the left [capital S rotated<br>
90 degrees left]. But as the anterior half of the canal is moveable, and<br>
liable thereby to obliterate the general form, while the posterior half<br>
is fixed, I shall direct attention to the latter half chiefly, since<br>
upon its peculiar form and relative position depends most of the<br>
difficulty in the performance of catheterism. The portion of the urethra<br>
which intervenes between the neck of the bladder, K, and the point E,<br>
where the penis is suspended from the front of the symphysis pubis by<br>
the suspensory ligament, assumes very nearly the form of a semicircle,<br>
whose anterior half looks towards the forepart, and whose posterior half<br>
is turned to the back of the pubis. The pubic arch, A, spans crossways,<br>
the middle of this part of the urethra, G, opposite the bulb H. The two<br>
extremes, F K, of this curve, and the lower part of the symphysis pubis,<br>
occupy in the adult the same antero-posterior level; and it follows,<br>
therefore, that the distance to which the urethra near its bulb, H, is<br>
removed from the pubic symphysis above must equal the depth of its own<br>
curve, which measures about an inch perpendicularly. The urethral<br>
aperture of the triangular ligament appears removed at this distance<br>
below the pubic symphysis, and that portion of the canal which lies<br>
behind the ligament, and ascends obliquely backwards and upwards to the<br>
vesical orifice on a level with the symphysis pubis in the adult should<br>
be remembered, as varying both in direction and length in individuals of<br>
the extremes of age. In the young, this variation is owing to the usual<br>
high position of the bladder in the pelvis, whilst in the old it may be<br>
caused by an enlarged state of the prostate. The curve of the urethra<br>
now described is permanent in all positions of the body, while that<br>
portion of the canal anterior to the point F, which is free, relaxed,<br>
and moveable, can by traction towards the umbilicus be made to continue<br>
in the direction of the fixed curve F K, and this is the general form<br>
which the urethra assumes when a bent catheter of ordinary shape is<br>
passed along the canal into the bladder. The length of the urethra<br>
varies at different ages and in different individuals, and its structure<br>
in the relaxed state is so very dilatable that it is not possible to<br>
estimate the width of its canal with fixed accuracy. As a general rule,<br>
the urethra is much more dilatable, and capable consequently of<br>
receiving an instrument of much larger bore in the aged than in the<br>
adult.<br>
<br>
The three portions into which the urethra is described as being<br>
divisible, are the spongy, the membranous, and the prostatic. These<br>
names indicate the difference in the structure of each part. The spongy<br>
portion is the longest of the three, and extending from the glans to the<br>
bulb may be said on a rough, but for practical purposes, a sufficiently<br>
accurate estimate to comprise seven parts of the whole urethra, which<br>
measures nine. The membranous and prostatic portions measure<br>
respectively one part of the whole. These relative proportions of the<br>
three parts are maintained in different individuals of the same age, and<br>
in the same individual at different ages. The spongy part occupies the<br>
inferior groove formed between the two united corpora cavernosa of the<br>
penis, and is subcutaneous as far back as the scrotum under the pubes,<br>
between which point and the bulb it becomes embraced by the accelerator<br>
urinae muscle. The bulb and glans are expansions or enlargements of the<br>
spongy texture, and do not affect the calibre of the canal. When the<br>
spongy texture becomes injected with blood, the canal is rendered much<br>
narrower than otherwise. The canal of the urethra is<br>
uniform-cylindrical. The meatus is the narrowest part of it, and the<br>
prostatic part is the widest. At the point of junction between the<br>
membranous and spongy portions behind the bulb, the canal is described<br>
as being naturally constricted. Behind the meatus exists a dilatation<br>
(fossa navicularis), and opposite the bulb another (sinus of the bulb).<br>
Muscular fibres are said to enter into the structure of the urethra, but<br>
whether such be the case or not, it is at least very certain that they<br>
never prove an obstacle to the passage of instruments, or form the<br>
variety of stricture known as spasmodic. The urethra is lined by a<br>
delicate mucous membrane presenting longitudinal folds, which become<br>
obliterated by distention; and its entire surface is numerously studded<br>
with the orifices of mucous cells (lacunae), one of which, larger than<br>
the rest, appears on the upper side of the canal near the meatus. Some<br>
of these lacunae are nearly an inch long, and all of them open in an<br>
oblique direction forwards. Instruments having very narrow apices are<br>
liable to enter these ducts and to make false passages. The ducts of<br>
Cowper's glands open by very minute orifices on the sides of the spongy<br>
urethra anterior to and near the bulb. On the floor of the prostatic<br>
urethra appears the crest of the veru montanum, upon which the two<br>
seminal ducts open by orifices directed forwards. On either side of the<br>
veru montanum the floor of the prostate may be seen perforated by the<br>
"excretory ducts" of this so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">gland.</span>
The part K, which is here<br>
represented as projecting from the floor of the bladder, near its neck,<br>
is named the "uvula vesicae," (Lieutaud.) It is the same as that which<br>
is named the "third lobe of the prostate," (Home.) The part does not<br>
appear as proper to the bladder in the healthy condition, Fig. 2, Plate<br>
56. On either side of the point K may be seen the orifices, M M, of the<br>
ureters, opening upon two ridges of fibrous substance directed towards<br>
the uvula. These are the fibres which have been named by Sir Charles<br>
Bell as "the muscles of the ureters;" but as they do not appear in the<br>
bladder when in a state of health, I do not believe that nature ever<br>
intended them to perform the function assigned to them by this<br>
anatomist. And the same may be said of the fibres, which surrounding the<br>
vesical orifice, are supposed to act as the "sphincter vesicae." The<br>
form of that portion of the base of the bladder which is named "trigone<br>
vesical" constitutes an equilateral triangle, and may be described by<br>
two lines drawn from the vesical orifice to both openings of the<br>
ureters, and another line reaching transversely between the latter.<br>
Behind the trigone a depression called "bas fond" is formed in the base<br>
of the bladder. Fig. 2, Plate 56, represents the prostate of a boy nine<br>
years of age. Fig. 3, Plate 56, represents that of a man aged forty<br>
years. A difference as to form and size, &amp;c., is observable between<br>
both.<br>
