<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATES 30 &amp; 31.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, AND EIGHTH<br>
LAYERS OF THE INGUINAL REGION, AND THEIR CONNEXION WITH THOSE<br>
OF THE THIGH.<br>
<br>
When we remove the internal oblique and cremaster muscles, we expose the<br>
transverse muscle, which may be regarded as the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">fifth inguinal layer</span>, F,<br>
Pl. 30. This muscle is similar in shape and dimensions to the internal<br>
oblique. The connexions of both are also similar, inasmuch as they arise<br>
from the inner edge of the crista ilii, and from the outer half of, V,<br>
Poupart's ligament. The fleshy fibres of these two muscles vary but<br>
little in direction, and terminate at the same place--viz., the linea<br>
semilunaris, which marks the outer border of the rectus muscle. But<br>
whilst the fleshy parts of these three abdominal muscles, D E F, form<br>
successive strata in the groin, their aponeurotic tendons present the<br>
following peculiarities of arrangement in respect to the rectus muscle.<br>
The tendon of the external oblique, <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>,
passes altogether in front of the<br>
rectus; that of the internal oblique is split opposite the linea<br>
semilunaris into two layers, which enclose the rectus between them as<br>
they pass to be inserted into the linea alba. But midway between the<br>
navel and pubes, at the point marked G, both layers of the tendon are<br>
found to pass in front of the rectus. The tendon of the transverse<br>
muscle passes behind the rectus; but opposite the point G, it joins both<br>
layers of the internal oblique tendon, and with this passes in front of<br>
the rectus. The fibrous structure thus constituted by the union of the<br>
tendons of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">e f,</span> is named<br>
the "conjoined tendon."<br>
<br>
The conjoined tendon, <span style="font-style: italic;">f,</span>
Plates 30 and 31, appears as a continuation of<br>
the linea semilunaris, for this latter is in itself a result of the<br>
union of the tendons of the abdominal muscles at the external border of<br>
the rectus. As the conjoined tendon curves so far outwards to its<br>
insertion into the pectineal ridge of the pubic bone, as to occupy a<br>
situation immediately behind the external ring, it thereby fortifies<br>
this part against the occurrence of a direct protrusion of the bowel.<br>
But the breadth, as well as the density, of this tendon varies in<br>
several individuals, and these will accordingly be more or less liable<br>
to the occurrence of hernia.<br>
<br>
The arched inferior border of the transverse muscle, F, Plate 30,<br>
expresses by its abrupt termination that some part is wanting to it; and<br>
this appearance, together with the fact that the fibres of this part of<br>
the muscle blend with those of the internal oblique and cremaster, and<br>
cannot be separated except by severing the connexion, at once suggests<br>
the idea that the cremaster is a derivation from both these muscles.<br>
<br>
Assuming this to be the case, therefore, it follows that when the<br>
dissector removes the cremaster from the space L <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, he himself causes<br>
this vacancy in the muscular parietes of the groin to occur, and at the<br>
same time gives unnatural definition to the lower border of the<br>
transverse and oblique muscles. In a dissection so conducted, the cord<br>
is made to assume the variable positions which anatomists report it to<br>
have in respect to the neighbouring muscles. But when we view nature as<br>
she is, and not as fashioned by the scalpel, we never fail to find an<br>
easy explanation of her form.<br>
<br>
In the foetus, prior to the descent of the testicle, the cremaster<br>
muscle does not exist. (Cloquet, op cit.) From this we infer, that those<br>
parts of the muscles, E F, Plate 30, which at a subsequent period are<br>
converted into a cremaster, entirely occupy the space L <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h</span>. In the adult<br>
body, where one of the testicles has been arrested in the inguinal<br>
canal, the muscles, E F, do not present a defined arched margin, above<br>
the vacant space L <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, but are
continued (as in the foetus) as low down<br>
as the external abdominal ring. In the adult, where the testicle has<br>
descended to the scrotum, the cremaster exists, and is serially<br>
continuous with the muscles, E F, covering the space L <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h</span>; the meaning of<br>
which is, that the cremasteric parts of the muscles, E F, cover this<br>
space. The name cremaster therefore must not cancel the fact that the<br>
fibres so named are parts of the muscles, E F. Again, in the female<br>
devoid of a cremaster, the muscles, E F, present of their full<br>
quantities, having sustained no diminution of their bulk by the<br>
formation of a cremaster. But when an external inguinal hernia occurs in<br>
the female body, the bowel during its descent carries before it a<br>
cremasteric covering at the expense of the muscles E F, just in the same<br>
way as the testicle does in the foetus. (Cloquet.)<br>
<br>
From the above-mentioned facts, viewed comparatively, it seems that the<br>
following inferences may be legitimately drawn:--1st, that the space L <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h</span><br>
does not naturally exist devoid of a muscular covering; for, in fact,<br>
the cremaster overlies this situation; 2nd, that the name cremaster is<br>
one given to the lower fibres of the internal oblique and transverse<br>
muscles which cover this space; and 3rd, that to separate the<br>
cremasteric elongation of these muscles, and then describe them as<br>
presenting a defined arched margin, an inch or two above Poupart's<br>
ligament, is an act as arbitrary on the part of the dissector as if he<br>
were to subdivide these muscles still more, and, while regarding the<br>
subdivisions as different structures, to give them names of different<br>
signification. When once we consent to regard the cremaster as<br>
constituted of the fibres originally proper to the muscles, E F, we then<br>
are led to the discovery of the true relations of the cord in respect to<br>
these muscles.<br>
<br>
On removing the transverse muscle, we expose the inguinal part of the<br>
transversalis fascia--the <span style="font-style: italic;">sixth
inguinal layer</span>, L <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>,
Plate 30--K <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span>,<br>
Plate 31. This fascia or membrane affords a general lining to the<br>
abdominal walls, in some parts of which it presents of a denser and<br>
stronger texture than in others. It is stretched over the abdomen<br>
between the muscles and the peritonaeum. The fascia iliaca, the fascia<br>
pelvica, and the fascia transversalis, are only regional divisions of<br>
the one general membrane. On viewing this fascia in its totality, I find<br>
it to exhibit many features in common with those other fibrous<br>
structures which envelope serous cavities. The transversalis fascia<br>
supports externally the peritonaeum, in the same way as the dura mater<br>
supports the arachnoid membrane, or as the pleural fascia supports the<br>
serous pleura. While the serous membranes form completely shut sacs, the<br>
fibrous membranes which lie external to those sacs are pierced by the<br>
vessels which course between them and the serous membranes, and afford<br>
sheaths or envelopes for these vessels in their passage from the<br>
interior to the external parts. The sheath, H <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, Plates 30 and 31, which<br>
surrounds the spermatic vessels, and the sheath, R, Plate 31, which<br>
envelopes the crural vessels, are elongations of the fascia<br>
transversalis.<br>
<br>
In the groin, the transversalis fascia, K <span
 style="font-style: italic;">k</span>, Plate 31, presents, in<br>
general, so dense a texture as to offer considerable resistance to<br>
visceral pressure. Here it is stretched between the transverse muscle,<br>
F, Plate 31, and the peritonaeum, I. It adheres to the external surface<br>
of the peritonaeum, and to the internal surface of the transverse<br>
muscle, by means of an intervening cellular tissue. It is connected<br>
below to Poupart's ligament, along the line of which it joins the fascia<br>
iliaca. It lines the lower posterior aspect of the rectus muscle, where<br>
this is devoid of its sheath; and it is incorporated with <span
 style="font-style: italic;">f,</span> the<br>
conjoined tendon, thereby fencing the external abdominal ring.<br>
Immediately above the middle of Poupart's ligament, this membrane, at<br>
the point marked <span style="font-style: italic;">h, </span>Plate
30, is pouched into a canal-shaped elongation,<br>
which invests the spermatic vessels as far as the testicle in the<br>
scrotum; and to this elongation is given the names "fascia spermatica<br>
interna" (Cooper), "fascia infundibuliform" (Cloquet). The same part,<br>
when it encloses an external oblique hernia, is named "fascia propria."<br>
The neck or inlet of this funnel-shaped canal is oval, and named the<br>
"internal abdominal ring." As this ring looks towards the interior of<br>
the abdomen, and forms the entrance of the funnel-shaped canal, it<br>
cannot of course be seen from before until we slit open this canal.<br>
Compare the parts marked H <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>
in Plates 30 and 31.<br>
<br>
The inguinal and iliac portions of the fascia transversalis join along<br>
the line of Poupart's ligament, A C. The iliac vessels, in their passage<br>
to the thigh, encounter the fascia at the middle third of the crural<br>
arch formed by the ligament, and take an investment (the sheath, R) from<br>
the fascia. The fore part of this sheath is mentioned as formed by the<br>
fascia transversalis--the back part by the fascia iliaca; but these<br>
distinctions are merely nominal, and it is therefore unnecessary to<br>
dwell upon them. The sheath of the femoral vessels is also<br>
funnel-shaped, and surrounds them on all sides. Its broad entrance lies<br>
beneath the middle of Poupart's ligament. Several septa are met with in<br>
its interior. These serve to separate the femoral vessels from each<br>
other. The femoral vein, O, Plate 30, is separated from the falciform<br>
margin, S <span style="font-style: italic;">s</span>, of the saphenous
opening by one of these septa. Between<br>
this septum and the falx an interval occurs, and through it the crural<br>
hernia usually descends. These parts will be more particularly noticed<br>
when considering the anatomy of crural hernia.<br>
<br>
Beneath the fascia transversalis is found the subserous cellular<br>
membrane, which serves as a connecting medium between the fascia and the<br>
peritonaeum. This cellular membrane may be considered as the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">seventh</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">inguinal layer.</span> It is
described by Scarpa (sull' Ernie) as forming an<br>
investment for the spermatic vessels inside the sheath, where it is<br>
copious, especially in old inguinal hernia. It is also sometimes mixed<br>
with fatty tissue. In it is found embedded the infantile cord--the<br>
remains of the upper part of the peritoneal tunica vaginalis--a<br>
structure which will be considered in connexion with congenital herniae.<br>
<br>
By removing the subserous cellular tissue, we lay bare the peritonaeum,<br>
which forms the <span style="font-style: italic;">eighth layer of the
inguinal region.</span> Upon it the<br>
epigastric and spermatic vessels are seen to rest. These vessels course<br>
between the fascia transversalis and the peritonaeum. The internal ring<br>
which is formed in the fascia, K <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>,
may be now seen to be closed by the<br>
peritonaeum, I. The inguinal canal, therefore, does not, in the normal<br>
state of these parts, communicate with the general serous cavity; and<br>
here it must be evident that before the bowel, which is situated<br>
immediately behind the peritonaeum, I, can be received into the canal, H<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">h,</span> it must either rupture that
membrane, or elongate it in the form of a<br>
sac.<br>
<br>
The exact position which the epigastric, L, Plate 31, and spermatic<br>
vessels, M, bear in respect to the internal ring, is a point of chief<br>
importance in the surgical anatomy of the groin; for the various forms<br>
of herniae which protrude through this part have an intimate relation to<br>
these vessels. The epigastric artery, in general, arises from the<br>
external iliac, close above the middle of Poupart's ligament, and<br>
ascends the inguinal wall in an oblique course towards the navel. It<br>
applies itself to the inner border of the internal ring, and here it is<br>
crossed on its outer side by the spermatic vessels, as these are about<br>
to enter the inguinal canal.<br>
<br>
The inguinal canal is the natural channel through which the spermatic<br>
vessels traverse the groin on their way to the testicle in the scrotum.<br>
In the remarks which have been already made respecting the several<br>
layers of structures found in the groin, I endeavoured to realize the<br>
idea of an inguinal canal as consisting of elongations of these layers<br>
invaginated the one within the other, the outermost layer being the<br>
integument of the groin elongated into the scrotal skin, whilst the<br>
innermost layer consisted of the transversalis fascia elongated into the<br>
fascia spermatica interna, or sheath. The peritonaeum, which forms the<br>
eighth layer of the groin, was seen to be drawn across the internal ring<br>
of this canal above in such a way as to close it completely, whilst all<br>
the other layers, seven in number, were described as being continued<br>
over the spermatic vessels in the form of funnel-shaped investments, as<br>
far down as the testicle.<br>
<br>
With the ideas of an inguinal canal thus naturally constituted, I need<br>
not hesitate to assert that the form, the extent, and the boundaries of<br>
the inguinal canal, as given by the descriptive anatomist, are purely<br>
conventional, and do not exist until after dissection; for which reason,<br>
and also because the form and condition of these parts so described and<br>
dissected do not appear absolutely to correspond in any two individuals,<br>
I omit to mention the scale of measurements drawn up by some eminent<br>
surgeons, with the object of determining the precise relative position<br>
of the several parts of the inguinal region.<br>
<br>
The existence of an inguinal canal consisting, as I have described it,<br>
of funnel-shaped elongations from the several inguinal layers continued<br>
over the cord as far as the testicle, renders the adult male especially<br>
liable to hernial protrusions at this part. The oblique direction of the<br>
canal is, in some measure, a safeguard against these accidents; but this<br>
obliquity is not of the same degree in all bodies, and hence some are<br>
naturally more prone to herniae than others.<br>
