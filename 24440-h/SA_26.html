<big><big>SURGICAL ANATOMY by JOSEPH MACLISE<br>
<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATE 26.<br>
<br>
THE RELATION OF THE INTERNAL PARTS<br>
TO THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE BODY.<br>
<br>
An exact acquaintance with the normal character of the external form,<br>
its natural prominences and depressions, produced by the projecting<br>
swell of muscles and points of bone, &amp;c., is of great practical<br>
importance to the surgeon. These several marks described on the<br>
superficies he takes as certain guides to the precise locality and<br>
relations of the more deeply situated organs. And as, by dissection,<br>
Nature reveals to him the fact that she holds constant to these<br>
relations, so, at least, may all that department of practice which he<br>
bases upon this anatomical certainty be accounted as rooted in truth and<br>
governed by fixed principles. The same organ bears the same special and<br>
general relations in all bodies, not only of the human, but of all other<br>
species of vertebrata; and from this evidence we conclude that the same<br>
marks on surface indicate the exact situation of the same organs in all<br>
similar bodies.<br>
<br>
The surface of the well-formed human body presents to our observation<br>
certain standard characters with which we compare all its abnormal<br>
conditions. Every region of the body exhibits fixed character proper to<br>
its surface. The neck, the axilla, the thorax, the abdomen, the groin,<br>
have each their special marks, by which we know them; and the eye, well<br>
versed in the characters proper to the healthy state of each, will<br>
soonest discover the nature of all effects of injury--such as<br>
dislocations, fractures, tumours of various kinds, &amp;c. By our<br>
acquaintance with the perfect, we discover the imperfect; by a<br>
comparison with the geometrically true rectangled triangle, or circle,<br>
we estimate the error of these forms when they have become distorted;<br>
and in the same way, by a knowledge of what is the healthy normal<br>
standard of human form, we diagnose correctly its slightest degree of<br>
deformity, produced by any cause whatever, whether by sudden accident,<br>
or slowly-approaching disease.<br>
<br>
Now, the abnormal conditions of the surface become at once apparent to<br>
our senses; but those diseased conditions which concern the internal<br>
organs require no ordinary exercise of judgment to discover them. The<br>
outward form masks the internal parts, and conceals from our direct<br>
view, like the covers of a closed volume, the marvellous history<br>
contained within. But still the superficies is so moulded upon the<br>
deeper situated structures, that we are induced to study it as a map,<br>
which discourses of all which it incloses in the healthy or the diseased<br>
state. Thus, the sternum points to A, the aorta; the middle of the<br>
clavicles, to C, the subclavian vessels; the localities 9, 10 of the<br>
coracoid processes indicate the place of the axillary vessels; the<br>
navel, P, points to Q, the bifurcation of the aorta; the pubic<br>
symphysis, Z, directs to the urinary bladder, Y. At the points 7, 8, may<br>
be felt the anterior superior spinous processes of the iliac bones,<br>
between which points and Z, the iliac vessels, V, 6, pass midway to the<br>
thigh, and give off the epigastric vessels, 2, 3, to the abdominal<br>
parietes. Between these points of general relations, which we trace on<br>
the surface of the trunk of the body, the anatomist includes the entire<br>
history of the special relations of the organs within contained. And not<br>
until he is capable of summing together the whole picture of anatomical<br>
analysis, and of viewing this in all its intricate relationary<br>
combination--even through and beneath the closed surface of living<br>
moving nature, is he prepared to estimate the conditions of disease, or<br>
interfere for its removal.<br>
<br>
When fluid accumulates on either side of the thoracic compartment to<br>
such an excess that an opening is required to be made for its exit from<br>
the body, the operator, who is best acquainted with the relations of the<br>
parts in a state of health, is enabled to judge with most correctness in<br>
how far these parts, when in a state of disease, have swerved from these<br>
proper relations. In the normal state of the thoracic viscera, the left<br>
thoracic space, G A K N, is occupied by the heart and left lung. The<br>
space indicated within the points A N K, in the anterior region of the<br>
thorax, is occupied by the heart, which, however, is partially<br>
overlapped by the anterior edge of the lung, PLATE 22. If the thorax be<br>
deeply penetrated at any part of this region, the instrument will wound<br>
either the lung or the heart, according to the situation of the wound.<br>
But when fluid becomes effused in any considerable quantity within the<br>
pleural sac, it occupies space between the lung and the thoracic walls;<br>
and the fluid compresses the lung, or displaces the heart from the left<br>
side towards the right. This displacement may take place to such an<br>
extent, that the heart, instead of occupying the left thoracic angle, A<br>
K N, assumes the position of A K* N on the right side. Therefore, as the<br>
fluid, whatever be its quantity, intervenes between the thoracic walls,<br>
K K*, and the compressed lung, the operation of paracentesis thoracis<br>
should be performed at the point K, or between K and the latissimus<br>
dorsi muscle, so as to avoid any possibility of wounding the heart. The<br>
intercostal artery at K is not of any considerable size.<br>
<br>
In the normal state of the thoracic organs, the pericardial envelope of<br>
the heart is at all times more or less uncovered by the anterior edge of<br>
the left lung, as seen in PLATE 22. When serous or other fluid<br>
accumulates to an excess in the pericardium, so as considerably to<br>
distend this sac, it must happen that a greater area of pericardial<br>
surface will be exposed and brought into immediate contact with the<br>
thoracic walls on the left side of the sternal median line, to the<br>
exclusion of the left lung, which now no longer interposes between the<br>
heart and the thorax. At this locality, therefore, a puncture may be<br>
made through the thoracic walls, directly into the distended<br>
pericardium, for the escape of its fluid contents, if such proceeding be<br>
in other respects deemed prudent and advisable.<br>
<br>
The abdominal cavity being very frequently the seat of dropsical<br>
effusion, when this takes place to any great extent, despite the<br>
continued and free use of the medicinal diuretic and the hydragogue<br>
cathartic, the surgeon is required to make an opening with the<br>
instrumental hydragogue--viz., the trocar and cannula. The proper<br>
locality whereat the puncture is to be made so as to avoid any large<br>
bloodvessel or other important organ, is at the middle third of the<br>
median line, between P the umbilicus, and Z the symphysis pubis. The<br>
anatomist chooses this median line as the safest place in which to<br>
perform paracentesis abdominis, well knowing the situation of 2, 3, the<br>
epigastric vessels, and of Y, the urinary bladder.<br>
<br>
All kinds of fluid occupying the cavities of the body gravitate towards<br>
the most depending part; and therefore, as in the sitting or standing<br>
posture, the fluid of ascites falls upon the line P Z, the propriety of<br>
giving the patient this position, and of choosing some point within the<br>
line P Z, for the place whereat to make the opening, becomes obvious. In<br>
the female, the ovary is frequently the seat of dropsical accumulation<br>
to such an extent as to distend the abdomen very considerably. Ovarian<br>
dropsy is distinguished from ascites by the particular form and<br>
situation of the swelling. In ascites, the abdominal swell is<br>
symmetrical, when the body stands or sits erect. In ovarian dropsy, the<br>
tumour is greatest on either side of the median line, according as the<br>
affected ovary happens to be the right or the left one.<br>
<br>
The fluid of ascites and that of the ovarian dropsy affect the position<br>
of the abdominal viscera variously In ascites, the fluid gravitates to<br>
whichever side the body inclines, and it displaces the moveable viscera<br>
towards the opposite side. Therefore, to whichever side the abdominal<br>
fluid gravitates, we may expect to find it occupying space between the<br>
abdominal parietes and the small intestines. The ovarian tumour is, on<br>
the contrary, comparatively fixed to either side of the abdominal median<br>
line; and whether it be the right or left ovary that is affected, it<br>
permanently displaces the intestines on its own side; and the sac lies<br>
in contact with the neighbouring abdominal parietes; nor will the<br>
intestines and it change position according to the line of gravitation.<br>
<br>
Now, though the above-mentioned circumstances be anatomically true<br>
respecting dropsical effusion within the general peritonaeal sac and<br>
that of the ovary, there are many urgent reasons for preferring to all<br>
other localities the line P Z, as the only proper one for puncturing the<br>
abdomen so as to give exit to the fluid. For though the peritonaeal<br>
ascites does, according to the position of the patient, gravitate to<br>
either side of the abdomen, and displace the moveable viscera on that<br>
side, we should recollect that some of these are bound fixedly to one<br>
place, and cannot be floated aside by the gravitating fluid. The liver<br>
is fixed to the right side, 11, by its suspensory ligaments. The<br>
spleen occupies the left side, 12. The caecum and the sigmoid flexure of<br>
the colon occupy, R R*, the right and left iliac regions. The colon<br>
ranges transversely across the abdomen, at P. The stomach lies<br>
transversely between the points, 11, 12. The kidneys, O, occupy the<br>
lumbar region. All these organs continue to hold their proper places, to<br>
whatever extent the dropsical effusion may take place, and<br>
notwithstanding the various inclinations of the body in this or that<br>
direction. On this account, therefore, we avoid performing the operation<br>
of paracentesis abdominis at any part except the median line, P Z; and<br>
as to this place, we prefer it to all others, for the following cogent<br>
reasons--viz., the absence of any large artery; the absence of any<br>
important viscus; the fact that the contained fluid gravitates in large<br>
quantity, and in immediate contact with the abdominal walls anteriorly,<br>
and interposes itself between these walls and the small intestines,<br>
which float free, and cannot approach the parietes of the abdomen nearer<br>
than the length which the mesenteric bond allows.<br>
<br>
If the ovarian dropsy form a considerable tumour in the abdomen, it may<br>
be readily reached by the trocar and cannula penetrating the line P Z.<br>
And thus we avoid the situation of the epigastric vessels. The puncture<br>
through the linea alba should never be made below the point, midway<br>
between P and Z, lest we wound the urinary bladder, which, when<br>
distended, rises considerably above the pubic symphysis.<br>
<br>
Amongst the many mechanical obstructions which, by impeding the<br>
circulation, give rise to dropsical effusion, are the following:--An<br>
aneurismal tumour of the aorta, A, or the innominate artery, [Footnote
1] <br>
F, may press upon the veins, H or D, and cause an oedematous swelling<br>
of the corresponding side of the face and the right arm. In the same way<br>
an aneurism of the aorta, Q, by pressing upon the inferior vena cava, T,<br>
may cause oedema of the lower limbs. Serum may accumulate in the<br>
pericardium, owing to an obstruction of the cardiac veins, caused by<br>
hypertrophy of the substance of the heart; and when from this cause the<br>
pericardium becomes much distended with fluid, the pressure of this upon<br>
the flaccid auricles and large venous trunks may give rise to general<br>
anasarca, to hydrothorax or ascites, either separate or co-existing.<br>
Tuberculous deposits in the lungs and scrofulous bronchial glands may<br>
cause obstructive pressure on the pulmonary veins, followed by effusion<br>
of either pus or serum into the pleural sac. [Footnote 2] An abscess or<br>
other tumour of the liver may, by pressing on the vena portae, cause<br>
serous effusion into the peritonaeal sac; or by pressure on the inferior<br>
vena cava, which is connected with the posterior thick border of the<br>
liver, may cause anasarca of the lower limbs. Matter accumulating<br>
habitually in the sigmoid flexure of the colon may cause a hydrocele, or<br>
a varicocele, by pressing on the spermatic veins of the left side. It is<br>
quite true that these two last-named affections appear more frequently<br>
on the left side than on the right; and it seems to me much more<br>
rational to attribute them to the above-mentioned circumstance than to<br>
the fact that the left spermatic veins open, at a disadvantageous right<br>
angle, into the left renal vein.<br>
<br>
[Footnote 1: The situation of this vessel, its close relation to the<br>
pleura, the aorta, the large venous trunks, the vagus and phrenic<br>
nerves, and the uncertainty as to its length, or as to whether or not a<br>
thyroid or vertebral branch arises from it, are circumstances which<br>
render the operation of tying the vessel in cases of aneurism very<br>
doubtful as to a successful issue. The operation (so far as I know) has<br>
hitherto failed. Anatomical relations, nearly similar to these, prevent,<br>
in like manner, an easy access to the iliac arteries, and cause the<br>
operator much anxiety as to the issue.]<br>
<br>
[Footnote 2: The effusion of fluid into the pleural sac (from whatever<br>
cause it may arise) sometimes takes place to a very remarkable extent. I<br>
have had opportunities of examining patients, in whom the heart appeared<br>
to be completely dislocated, from the left to the right side, owing to<br>
the large collection of serous fluid in the left pleural sac. The<br>
heart's pulsations could be felt distinctly under the right nipple.<br>
Paracentesis thoracis was performed at the point indicated in PLATE 26.<br>
In these cases, and another observed at the Hotel Dieu, the heart and<br>
lung, in consequence of the extensive adhesions which they contracted in<br>
their abnormal position, did not immediately resume their proper<br>
situation when the fluid was withdrawn from the chest. Nor is it to be<br>
expected that they should ever return to their normal character and<br>
position, when the disease which caused their displacement has been of<br>
long standing.]<br>
