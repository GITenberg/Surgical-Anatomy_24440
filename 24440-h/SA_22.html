COMMENTARY ON PLATE 22.<br>
<br>
THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE SUPERFICIAL ORGANS OF THE THORAX AND
ABDOMEN.<br>
<br>
In the osseous skeleton, the thorax and abdomen constitute a common<br>
compartment. We cannot, while we contemplate this skeleton, isolate the<br>
one region from the other by fact or fancy. The only difference which I<br>
can discover between the regions called thorax and abdomen, in the<br>
osseous skeleton, (considering this body morphologically,) results,<br>
simply, from the circumstance that the ribs, which enclose thoracic<br>
space, have no <span style="font-style: italic;">osseous </span>counterparts
in the abdomen enclosing abdominal<br>
space, and this difference is merely histological. In man and the<br>
mammalia the costal arches hold relation with the pulmonary organs, and<br>
these costae fail at that region where the ventral organs are located.<br>
In birds, and many reptiles, the costal arches enclose the common<br>
thoracico-abdominal region, as if it were a common pulmonary region. In<br>
fishes the costal arches enclose the thoracico-abdominal region, just as<br>
if it were a common abdominal region. I merely mention these general<br>
facts to show that costal enclosure does not actually serve to isolate<br>
the thorax from the abdomen in the lower classes of animals; and on<br>
turning to the human form, I find that this line of separation between<br>
the two compartments is so very indefinite, that, as pathologists, we<br>
are very liable to err in our diagnosis between the diseased and the<br>
healthy organs of either region, as they lie in relation with the<br>
moveable diaphragm or septum in the living body. The contents of the<br>
whole trunk of the body from the top of the sternum to the perineum are<br>
influenced by the respiratory motions; and it is most true that the<br>
diaphragmatic line, H F H*, is alternately occupied by those organs<br>
situated immediately above and below it during the performance of these<br>
motions, even in health.<br>
<br>
The organs of the thoracic region hold a certain relation to each other<br>
and to the thoracic walls. The organs of the abdomen hold likewise a<br>
certain relation to each other and to the abdominal parietes. The organs<br>
of both the thorax and the abdomen have a certain relation to each<br>
other, as they lie above and below the diaphragm. In dead nature these<br>
relations are fixed and readily ascertainable, but in living, moving<br>
nature, the organs influence this relative position, not only of each<br>
other, but also of that which they bear to the cavities in which they<br>
are contained. This change of place among the organs occurs in the<br>
normal or healthy state of the living body, and, doubtless, raises some<br>
difficulty in the way of our ascertaining, with mathematical precision,<br>
the actual state of the parts which we question, by the physical signs<br>
of percussion and auscultation. In disease this change of place among<br>
these organs is increased, and the difficulty of making a correct<br>
diagnosis is increased also in the same ratio. For when an emphysematous<br>
lung shall fully occupy the right thoracic side from B to L, then G, the<br>
liver, will protrude considerably into the abdomen beneath the right<br>
asternal ribs, and yet will not be therefore proof positive that the<br>
liver is diseased and abnormally enlarged. Whereas, on the other hand,<br>
when G, the liver, is actually diseased, it may occupy a situation in<br>
the right side as high as the fifth or sixth ribs, pushing the right<br>
lung upwards as high as that level; and, therefore, while percussion<br>
elicits a dull sound over this place thus occupied, such sound will not<br>
be owing to a hepatized lung, but to the absence of the lung caused by<br>
the presence of the liver.<br>
<br>
In the healthy adult male body, Plate 22, the two lungs, D D*, whilst in<br>
their ordinary expanded state, may be said to range over all that region<br>
of the trunk of the body which is marked by the sternal and asternal<br>
ribs. The heart, E, occupies the thoracic centre, and part of the left<br>
thoracic side. The heart is almost completely enveloped in the two<br>
lungs. The only portion of the heart and pericardium, which appears<br>
uncovered by the lung on opening the thorax, is the base of the right<br>
ventricle, E, situated immediately behind the lower end of the sternum,<br>
where this bone is joined by the cartilages of the sixth and seventh<br>
ribs. The lungs range perpendicularly from points an inch above B, the<br>
first rib, downwards to L, the tenth rib, and obliquely downwards and<br>
backwards to the vertebral ends of the last ribs. This space varies in<br>
capacity, according to the degree in which the lungs are expanded within<br>
it. The increase in thoracic space is attained, laterally, by the<br>
expansion of the ribs, C I; and vertically, by the descent of the<br>
diaphragm, H, which forces downwards the mass of abdominal viscera. The<br>
contraction of thoracic space is caused by the approximation of all the<br>
ribs on each side to each other; and by the ascent of the diaphragm. The<br>
expansion of the lungs around the heart would compress this organ, were<br>
it not that the costal sides yield laterally while the diaphragm itself<br>
descends. The heart follows the ascent and descent of the diaphragm,<br>
both in ordinary and forced respiration.<br>
<br>
But however much the lungs vary in capacity, or the heart as to position<br>
in the respiratory motions, still the lungs are always closely applied<br>
to the thoracic walls. Between the pleura costalis and pulmonalis there<br>
occurs no interval in health. The thoracic parietes expand and contract<br>
to a certain degree; and to that same degree, and no further, do the<br>
lungs within the thorax expand and contract. By no effort of expiration<br>
can the animal expel all the air completely from its lungs, since by no<br>
effort of its own, can it contract thoracic space beyond the natural<br>
limit. On the other hand, the utmost degree of expansion of which the<br>
lungs are capable, exactly equals that degree in which the thoracic<br>
walls are dilatable by the muscular effort; and, therefore, between the<br>
extremes of inspiration and expiration, the lungs still hold closely<br>
applied to the costal parietes. The air within the lungs is separated<br>
from the air external to the thorax, by the thoracic parietes. The air<br>
within and external to the lungs communicate at the open glottis. When<br>
the glottis closes and cuts off the communication, the respiratory act<br>
ceases--the lungs become immovable, and the thoracic walls are (so far<br>
as the motions of respiration are concerned) rendered immovable also.<br>
The muscles of respiration cannot, therefore, produce a vacuum between<br>
the pulmonic and costal pleura, either while the external air has or has<br>
not access to the lungs. Upon this fact the mechanism of respiration<br>
mainly depends; and we may see a still further proof of this in the<br>
circumstance that, when the thoracic parietes are pierced, so as to let<br>
the external air into the cavity of the pleura, the lung collapses and<br>
the thoracic side ceases to exert an expansile influence over the lung.<br>
When in cases of fracture of the rib the lung is wounded, and the air of<br>
the lung enters the pleura, the same effect is produced as when the<br>
external air was admitted through an opening in the side.<br>
<br>
When serous or purulent effusion takes place within the cavity of the<br>
pleura, the capacity of the lung becomes lessened according to the<br>
quantity of the effusion. It is more reasonable to expect that the soft<br>
tissue of the lung should yield to the quantity of fluid within the<br>
pleural cavity, than that the rigid costal walls should give way<br>
outwardly; and, therefore, it seldom happens that the practitioner can<br>
discover by the eye any strongly-marked difference between the thoracic<br>
walls externally, even when a considerable quantity of either serum,<br>
pus, or air, occupies the pleural sacs.<br>
<br>
In the healthy state of the thoracic organs, a sound characteristic of<br>
the presence of the lung adjacent to the walls of the thorax may be<br>
elicited by percussion, or heard during the respiratory act through the<br>
stethoscope, over all that costal space ranging anteriorly between B,<br>
the first rib, and I K, the eight and ninth ribs. The respiratory murmur<br>
can be heard below the level of these ribs posteriorly, for the lung<br>
descends behind the arching diaphragm as far as the eleventh rib.<br>
<br>
When fluid is effused into the pleural cavity, the ribs are not moved by<br>
the intercostal muscles opposite the place occupied by the fluid, for<br>
this has separated the lung from the ribs. The fluid has compressed the<br>
lung; and in the same ratio as the lung is prevented from expanding, the<br>
ribs become less moveable. The presence of fluid in the pleural sac is<br>
discoverable by dulness on percussion, and, as might be expected, by the<br>
absence of the respiratory murmur at that locality which the fluid<br>
occupies. Fluid, when effused into the pleural sac, will of course<br>
gravitate; and its position will vary according to the position of the<br>
patient. The sitting or standing posture will therefore suit best for<br>
the examination of the thorax in reference to the presence of fluid.<br>
<br>
Though the lungs are closely applied to the costal sides at all times in<br>
the healthy state of these organs, still they slide freely within the<br>
thorax during the respiratory motions--forwards and backwards--over the<br>
serous pericardium, E, and upwards and downwards along the pleura<br>
costalis. The length of the adhesions which supervene upon pleuritis<br>
gives evidence of the extent of these motions. When the lung becomes in<br>
part solidified and impervious to the inspired air, the motions of the<br>
thoracic parietes opposite to the part are impeded. Between a solidified<br>
lung and one which happens to be compressed by effused fluid it requires<br>
no small experience to distinguish a difference, either by percussion or<br>
the use of the stethoscope. It is great experience alone that can<br>
diagnose hydro-pericardium from hypertrophy of the substance of the<br>
heart by either of these means.<br>
<br>
The thoracic viscera gravitate according to the position of the body.<br>
The heart in its pericardial envelope sways to either side of the<br>
sternal median line according as the body lies on this or that side. The<br>
two lungs must, therefore, be alternately affected as to their capacity<br>
according as the heart occupies space on either side of the thorax. In<br>
expiration, the heart, E, is more uncovered by the shelving edges of the<br>
lungs than in inspiration. In pneumothorax of either of the pleural sacs<br>
the air compresses the lung, pushes the heart from its normal position,<br>
and the space which the air occupies in the pleura yields a clear hollow<br>
sound on percussion, whilst, by the ear or stethoscope applied to a<br>
corresponding part of the thoracic walls, we discover the absence of the<br>
respiratory murmur.<br>
<br>
The transverse diameter of the thoracic cavity varies at different<br>
levels from above downwards. The diameter which the two first ribs, B<br>
B*, measure, is the least. That which is measured by the two eighth<br>
ribs, I I*, is the greatest. The perpendicular depth of the thorax,<br>
measured anteriorly, ranges from A, the top of the sternum, to F, the<br>
xyphoid cartilage. Posteriorly, the perpendicular range of the thoracic<br>
cavity measures from the spinous process of the seventh cervical<br>
vertebra above, to the last dorsal spinous process below. In full,<br>
deep-drawn inspiration in the healthy adult, the ear applied to the<br>
thoracic walls discovers the respiratory murmur over all the space<br>
included within the above mentioned bounds. After extreme expiration, if<br>
the thoracic walls be percussed, this capacity will be found much<br>
diminished; and the extreme limits of the thoracic space, which during<br>
full inspiration yielded a clear sound, indicative of the presence of<br>
the lung, will now, on percussion, manifest a dull sound, in consequence<br>
of the absence of the lung, which has receded from the place previously<br>
occupied.<br>
<br>
Owing to the conical form of the thoracic space, the apex of which is<br>
measured by the first ribs, B B*, and the basis by I I*, it will be seen<br>
that if percussion be made directly from before, backwards, over the<br>
pectoral masses, R R*, the pulmonic resonance will not be elicited. When<br>
we raise the arms from the side and percuss the thorax between the folds<br>
of the axillae, where the serratus magnus muscle alone intervenes<br>
between the ribs and the skin, the pulmonic sound will answer clearly.<br>
<br>
At the hypochondriac angles formed between the points F, L, N, on either<br>
side the lungs are absent both in inspiration and expiration.<br>
Percussion, when made over the surface of the angle of the right side,<br>
discovers the presence of the liver, G G*. When made over the median<br>
line, and on either side of it above the umbilicus, N, we ascertain the<br>
presence of the stomach, M M*. In the left hypochondriac angle, the<br>
stomach may also be found to occupy this place wholly.<br>
<br>
Beneath the umbilicus, N, and on either side of it as far outwards as<br>
the lower asternal ribs, K L, thus ranging the abdominal parietes<br>
transversely, percussion discovers the transverse colon, O, P, O*. The<br>
small intestines, S S*, covered by the omentum, P*, occupy the<br>
hypogastric and iliac regions.<br>
<br>
The organs situated within the thorax give evidence that they are<br>
developed in accordance to the law of symmetry. The lungs form a pair,<br>
one placed on either side of the median line. The heart is a double<br>
organ, formed of the right and left heart. The right lung differs from<br>
the left, inasmuch as we find the former divided into three lobes, while<br>
the latter has only two. That place which the heart now occupies in the<br>
left thoracic side is the place where the third or middle lobe of the<br>
left lung is wanting. In the abdomen we find that most of its organs are<br>
single. The liver, stomach, spleen, colon, and small intestine form a<br>
series of single organs: each of these may be cleft symmetrically. The<br>
kidneys are a pair.<br>
<br>
The extent to which the ribs are bared in the figure Plate 22, marks<br>
exactly the form and transverse capacity of the thoracic walls. The<br>
diaphragm, H H*, has had a portion of its forepart cut off, to show how<br>
it separates the thin edges of both lungs above from the liver, G, and<br>
the stomach, M, below. These latter organs, although occupying abdominal<br>
space, rise to a considerable height behind K L, the asternal ribs, a<br>
fact which should be borne in mind when percussing the walls of the<br>
thorax and abdomen at this region.<br>
