<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATES 50 &amp; 51.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURES OF THE<br>
MALE PERINAEUM.<br>
<br>
The median line of the body is marked as the situation where the<br>
opposite halves unite and constitute a perfect symmetrical figure. Every<br>
structure--superficial as well as deep--which occupies the median line<br>
is either single, by the union of halves, or dual, by the cleavage and<br>
partition of halves. The two sides of the body being absolutely similar,<br>
the median line at which they unite is therefore common to both. Union<br>
along the median line is an occlusion taking place by the junction of<br>
sides; and every hiatus or opening, whether normal or abnormal, which<br>
happens at this line, signifies an omission in the process of central<br>
union. The sexual peculiarities are the results of the operation of this<br>
law, and all forms which are anomalous to either sex, may be interpreted<br>
as gradations in the same process of development; a few of these latter<br>
occasionally come under the notice of the surgeon.<br>
<br>
The region which extends from the umbilicus to the point of the coccyx<br>
is marked upon the cutaneous surface by a central raphe dividing the<br>
hypogastrium, the penis, the scrotum, and the perinaeum respectively<br>
into equal and similar sides. The umbilicus is a cicatrix formed after<br>
the metamorphosis of a median foetal structure--the placental cord,
&amp;c.<br>
In the normal form, the meatus urinarius and the anus coincide with the<br>
line of the median raphe, and signify omissions at stated intervals<br>
along the line of central union. When between these intervals the<br>
process of union happens likewise to be arrested, malformations are the<br>
result; and of these the following are examples:--Extrusion of the<br>
bladder at the hypogastrium is caused by a congenital hiatus at the<br>
lower part of the linea alba, which is in the median line; Epispadias,<br>
which is an urethral opening on the dorsum of the penis; and<br>
Hypospadias, which is a similar opening on its under surface, are of the<br>
same nature--namely, omissions in median union. Hermaphrodism may be<br>
interpreted simply as a structural defect, compared to the normal form<br>
of the male, and as a structural excess compared to that of the female.<br>
Spina bifida is a congenital malformation or hiatus in union along the<br>
median line of the sacrum or loins. As the process of union along the<br>
median line may err by a defect or omission, so may it, on the other<br>
hand, err by an excess of fulfilment, as, for example, when the urethra,<br>
the vagina, or the anus are found to be imperforate. As the median line<br>
of union thus seems to influence the form of the hypogastrium, the<br>
genitals, and the perinaeum, the dissection of these parts has been<br>
conducted accordingly.<br>
<br>
By removing the skin and subjacent adipose membrane from the<br>
hypogastrium, we expose the superficial fascia. This membrane, E E E*,<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 50, is, in the middle line, adherent to B, the linea alba,<br>
and thereby contributes to form the central depression which extends<br>
from the navel to the pubes. The adipose tissue, which in some subjects<br>
accumulates on either side of the linea alba, renders this depression<br>
more marked in them. At the folds of the groin the fascia is found<br>
adherent to Poupart's ligament, and this also accounts for the<br>
depressions in both these localities. From the central linea alba to<br>
which the fascia adheres, outwards on either side to the folds of both<br>
groins, the membrane forms two distinct sacs, which droop down in front,<br>
so as to invest the testicles, E**, and penis in a manner similar to<br>
that of the skin covering these parts. As the two sacs of the<br>
superficial fascia join each other at the line B, coinciding with the<br>
linea alba, they form by that union the suspensory ligament of the<br>
penis, which is a structure precisely median.<br>
<br>
The superficial fascia having invested the testicles each in a distinct<br>
sac, the adjacent sides of both these sacs, by joining together, form<br>
the median septum scroti, E, Fig. 2, Plate 50. In the perinaeum, Fig. 1,<br>
Plate 51, the fascia, A, may be traced from the back of the scrotum to<br>
the anus. In this region the membrane is found to adhere laterally to<br>
the rami of the ischium and pubes; whilst along the median perinaeal<br>
line the two sacs of which the membrane is composed unite, as in the<br>
scrotum, and form an imperfect septum. In front of the anus, beneath the<br>
sphincter ani, the fascia degenerates into cellular membrane, one layer<br>
of which is spread over the adipose tissue in the ischio-rectal space,<br>
whilst its deeper and stronger layer unites with the deep perinaeal<br>
fascia, and by this connexion separates the urethral from the anal<br>
spaces. The superficial fascia of the hypogastrium, the scrotum, and the<br>
perinaeum forming a continuous membrane, and being adherent to the<br>
several parts above noticed, may be regarded as a general double sac,<br>
which isolates the inguino-perinaeal region from the femoral and anal<br>
regions, and hence it happens that when the urethra becomes ruptured,<br>
the urine which is extravasated in the perinaeum, is allowed to pass<br>
over the scrotum and the abdomen, involving these parts in consequent<br>
inflammation, whilst the thighs and anal space are exempt. The tunicae<br>
vaginales, which form the immediate coverings of the testicles, cannot<br>
be entered by the urine, as they are distinct sacs originally protruded<br>
from the abdomen. It is in consequence of the imperfect state of the<br>
inguino-perinaeal septum of the fascia, that urine effused into one of<br>
the sacs is allowed to enter the other.<br>
<br>
Like all the other structures which join on either side of the median<br>
line, the penis appears as a symmetrical organ, D D, Fig. 2, Plate 50.<br>
While viewed in section, its two corpora cavernosa are seen to unite<br>
anteriorly, and by this union to form a septum "pectiniforme;"<br>
posteriorly they remain distinct and lateral, F F, Fig. 2, Plate 51,<br>
being attached to the ischio-pubic rami as the crura penis. The urethra,<br>
B, Fig. 2, Plate 50, is also composed of two sides, united along the<br>
median line, but forming between them a canal by the cleavage and<br>
partition of the urethral septum. All the other structures of the<br>
perinaeum will be seen to be either double and lateral, or single and<br>
median, according as they stand apart from, or approach, or occupy the<br>
central line.<br>
<br>
The perinaeum, Figs. 1, 2, Plate 51, is that space which is bounded<br>
above by the arch of the pubes, behind by C, the os coccygis, and the<br>
lower borders of, I I, the glutaei muscles and sacro-sciatic ligaments,<br>
and laterally by D D, the ischiatic tuberosities. The osseous boundaries<br>
can be felt through the integuments. Between the back of the scrotum and<br>
the anus the perinaeum swells on both sides of the raphe, A B, Fig. 3,<br>
Plate 50, and assumes a form corresponding with the bag of the<br>
superficial fascia which encloses the structures connected with the<br>
urethra. The anus is centrally situated in the depression formed between<br>
D D, the ischiatic tuberosities, and the double folds of the nates.<br>
<br>
The perinaeum, Fig. 3, Plate 50, is, for surgical purposes, described as<br>
divisible into two spaces (anterior and posterior) by a transverse line<br>
drawn from one tuber ischii, D, to the other, D, and crossing in front<br>
of the anus. The anterior space, A D D, contains the urethra; the<br>
posterior space, D D C, contains the rectum. The central raphe, A B C,<br>
traverses both these spaces. The anterior or urethral space is (while<br>
viewed in reference to its osseous boundaries) triangular in shape, the<br>
apex being formed by the pubic symphysis beneath A, whilst two lines<br>
drawn from A to D D, would coincide with the ischio-pubic rami which<br>
form its sides. The raphe in the anterior space indicates the central<br>
position of the urethra, as may be ascertained by passing a sound into<br>
the bladder, when the shaft of the instrument will be felt prominently<br>
between the points A B. Behind the point B, the sound or staff sinks<br>
deeper in the perinaeum as it follows the curve of the urethra towards<br>
the bladder, and becomes overlaid by the bulb, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The ischiatic tuberosities, D D, Fig. 3, Plate 50, are, in all subjects,<br>
sufficiently prominent to be felt through the integuments, &amp;c.; and
the<br>
line which, when drawn from one to the other, serves to divide the two<br>
perinaeal spaces, forms the base of the anterior one. In well-formed<br>
subjects, the anterior space is equiangular, the base being equal to<br>
each side; but according as the tuberosities approach the median line,<br>
the base becomes narrowed, and the triangle is thereby rendered acute.<br>
These circumstances influence the direction in which the first incision<br>
in the lateral operation of lithotomy should be made. When the<br>
tuberosity of the left ischium stands well apart from the perinaeal<br>
centre, the line of incision, B E, Fig. 3, Plate 50, is carried<br>
obliquely from above downwards and outwards; but in cases where the<br>
tuberosity approaches the centre, the incision must necessarily be made<br>
more vertical. The posterior perinaeal space may be described on the<br>
surface by two lines drawn from D D, the ischiatic tuberosities, to C,<br>
the point of the coccyx, whilst the transverse line between D and D<br>
bounds it above.<br>
<br>
By removing the integument and superficial fascia, we expose the<br>
superficial vessels and nerves, together with the muscles in the<br>
neighbourhood of the urethra and the anus. The accelerator urinae, E,<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 51, which embraces the urethra, and the sphincter ani, B<br>
C, which surrounds the anus, H, occupy the median line, and are divided<br>
each into halves by a central tendon, E B C, which traverses the<br>
perinaeum from before backwards, to the point of the coccyx. On either<br>
side of the anus, in the ischio-rectal space, D D, Fig. 1, Plate 51, is<br>
found a considerable quantity of granular adipose tissue, traversed by<br>
the inferior haemorrhoidal arteries and nerves-branches of the pudic<br>
artery and nerve.<br>
<br>
In front of the anus are seen two small muscles (transversae perinaei),<br>
G G, Fig. 2, Plate 51, each arising from the tuber ischii of its own<br>
side, and the two becoming inserted into, B, the central tendon. These<br>
transverse muscles serve to mark the boundary between the anterior and<br>
posterior perinaeal spaces. Behind each muscle is found a small artery,<br>
crossing to the median line. The left transverse muscle and artery are<br>
always divided in the lateral operation of lithotomy. On the outer sides<br>
of the anterior perinaeal space are seen the erectores penis muscles, F<br>
F, overlaying the crura penis. Between each muscle and the accelerator<br>
urinae, the superficialis perinaei artery and nerve course forwards to<br>
the scrotum, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The perinaeal muscles having been brought fully into view, Plate 52,<br>
Fig. 1, their symmetrical arrangement on both sides of the median line<br>
at once strikes the attention. On either side of the anterior space<br>
appears a small angular interval, L, formed between B, the accelerator<br>
urinae, D, the erector penis, and E, the transverse muscle. Along the<br>
surface of this interval, the superficial perinaeal artery and nerve are<br>
seen to pass forwards; and deep in it, beneath these, may also be<br>
observed, L, the artery of the bulb, arising from the pudic, and<br>
crossing inwards, under cover of the anterior layer of the membrane<br>
named the deep perinaeal fascia. The first incision in the lateral<br>
operation of lithotomy is commenced over the inferior inner angle of<br>
this interval.<br>
<br>
The muscles occupying the anterior perinaeal space require to be<br>
removed, Fig. 1, Plate 53, in order to expose the urethra, B M, the crus<br>
penis, D, and the deep perinaeal fascia. The fascia will be now seen<br>
stretched across the subpubic triangular space, reaching from one<br>
ischio-pubic ramus to the other, whilst by its lower border,<br>
corresponding with the line of the transversae perinaei muscles, it<br>
becomes continuous with the superficial fascia, in the manner before<br>
described. The deep perinaeal fascia (triangular ligament) encloses<br>
between its two layers, C E, on either side of the urethra, the pudic<br>
artery, the artery of the bulb, Cowper's glands, and some muscular<br>
fibres occasionally to be met with, to which the name "Compressor<br>
urethrae" has been assigned. At this stage of the dissection, as the<br>
principal vessels and parts composed of erectile tissue are now in view,<br>
their relative situations should be well noticed, so as to avoid<br>
wounding them in the several cutting operations required to be performed<br>
in their vicinity.<br>
<br>
Along the median line (marked by the raphe) from the scrotum to the<br>
coccyx, and close to this line on either side, the vessels are<br>
unimportant as to size. The urethra lies along the middle line in the<br>
anterior perinaeal space; the rectum occupies the middle in the<br>
posterior space. When either of these parts specially requires to be<br>
incised--the urethra for impassable stricture, &amp;c., and the lower
part<br>
of the rectum for fistula in ano--the operation may be performed<br>
without fear of inducing dangerous arterial haemorrhage. With the object<br>
of preserving from injury these important parts, deep incisions at, or<br>
approaching to, the middle line must be avoided. The outer<br>
(ischio-pubic) boundary of the perinaeum is the line along which the<br>
pudic artery passes. The anterior half of this boundary supports also<br>
the crus penis; hence, therefore, in order to avoid these, all deep<br>
incisions should be made parallel to, but removed to a proper distance<br>
from this situation. The structures placed at the middle line, B M F,<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 52, and those in connexion with the left perinaeal<br>
boundary, D G L, require (in order to insure the safety of these parts)<br>
that the line of incision necessary to gain access to the neck of the<br>
bladder in lithotomy should be made through the left side of the<br>
perinaeum from a point midway between M, the bulb, and D, crus penis<br>
above, to a point, K, midway between the anus, F, and tuber ischii, G,<br>
below. As the upper end of this incision is commenced over the situation<br>
of the superficial perinaeal artery and the artery of the bulb, the<br>
knife at this place should only divide the skin and superficial fascia.<br>
The lower end, K, just clears the outer side of the dilated lower part<br>
of the rectum. The middle of the incision is over the left lobe of the<br>
prostate gland and neck of the bladder, which parts, together with the<br>
membranous portion of the urethra, are still concealed by the deep<br>
perinaeal fascia, the structures between its layers, and the anterior<br>
fibres of K, the levator ani muscle. The incision, if made in due<br>
reference to the relative situation of the parts above noticed, will<br>
leave them untouched; but when the pudic artery, or some one of its<br>
branches, deviates from its ordinary course and crosses the line of<br>
incision, a serious haemorrhage will ensue, despite the anatomical<br>
knowledge of the most experienced operator. When it is requisite to<br>
divide the superficial and deep sphincter ani as in the operation for<br>
complete fistula in ano, if the incision be made transversely in the<br>
ischio-rectal fossa, the haemorrhoidal arteries and nerves converging<br>
towards the anus will be the more likely to escape being wounded.<br>
