<big><big>COMMENTARY ON PLATES 3 &amp; 4.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL FORM OF THE SUPERFICIAL CERVICAL AND FACIAL<br>
REGIONS, AND THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE PRINCIPAL<br>
BLOOD-VESSELS, NERVES, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
When the neck is extended in surgical position, as seen in Plates 3 and<br>
4, its general outline assumes a quadrilateral shape, approaching to a<br>
square. The sides of this square are formed anteriorly by the line<br>
ranging from the mental symphysis to the top of the sternum, and<br>
posteriorly by a line drawn between the occiput and shoulder. The<br>
superior side of this cervical square is drawn by the horizontal ramus<br>
of the lower maxilla, and the inferior side by the horizontal line of<br>
the clavicle. This square space, R 16, 8, 6, Plate 4, is halved by a<br>
diagonal line, drawn by the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle B, which cuts<br>
the square into two triangles. In the anterior triangle, F 16, 6, Plate<br>
4, is located the superficial common carotid artery, C, and its<br>
branches, D, with accompanying nerves. In the posterior triangle, 9, 8,<br>
6, Plate 4, is placed the superficial subclavian artery, A, its<br>
branches, L M, and the brachial plexus of nerves, I. Both these<br>
triangles and their contents are completely sheathed by that thin<br>
scarf-like muscle, named platysma myoides, A A, Plate 3, the fibres of<br>
which traverse the neck slantingly in a line, O A, of diagonal direction<br>
opposite to and secant of that of the sterno-mastoid muscle.<br>
<br>
When the skin and subcutaneous adipose membrane are removed by careful<br>
dissection from the cervical region, certain structures are exposed,<br>
which, even in the undissected neck, projected on the superficies, and<br>
are the unerring guides to the localities of the blood-vessels and<br>
nerves, &amp;c. In Plate 4, the top of the sternum, 6; the clavicle, 7;
the<br>
"Pomum Adami," 1; the lower maxilla at V; the hyoid bone, Z; the<br>
sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, B; and the clavicular portion of the<br>
trapezius muscle, 8; will readily be felt or otherwise recognised<br>
through the skin, &amp;c. When these several points are well considered
in<br>
their relation to one another, they will correctly determine the<br>
relative locality of those structures--the blood-vessels, nerves,
&amp;c.,<br>
which mainly concern the surgical operation.<br>
<br>
The middle point, between 7, the clavicle, and 6, the sternum, of Plate<br>
4, is marked by a small triangular space occurring between the<br>
clavicular and sternal divisions of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle.<br>
This space marks the situation (very generally) of the bifurcation of<br>
the innominate artery into the subclavian and common carotid arteries of<br>
the right side; a penetrating instrument would, if passed into this<br>
space at an inch depth, pierce first the root of the internal jugular<br>
vein, and under it, but somewhat internal, the root of either of these<br>
great arterial vessels, and would wound the right vagus nerve, as it<br>
traverses this region. For some extent after the subclavian and carotid<br>
vessels separate from their main common trunk, they lie concealed<br>
beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, B, Plate 4, and still deeper beneath<br>
the sternal origins of the sterno-hyoid muscle, 5, and sterno-thyroid<br>
muscle, some of whose fibres are traceable at the intervals. The<br>
omo-hyoid muscle and the deep cervical fascia, as will be presently
seen,<br>
conceal these vessels also.<br>
<br>
The subclavian artery, A, Plate 4, first appears superficial to the<br>
above-named muscles of the cervical region just at the point where,<br>
passing from behind the scalenus muscle, N, Plate 4, which also conceals<br>
it, it sinks behind the clavicle. The exact locality of the artery in<br>
this part of its course would be indicated by a finger's breadth<br>
external to the clavicular attachment of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The<br>
artery passes beneath the clavicle at the middle of this bone, a point<br>
which is indicated in most subjects by that cellular interval occurring<br>
between the clavicular origins of the deltoid and great pectoral<br>
muscles.<br>
<br>
The posterior cervical triangle, 9, 8, 7, Plate 4, in which the<br>
subclavian artery is situated, is again subdivided by the muscle<br>
omo-hyoid into two lesser regions, each of which assumes somewhat of a<br>
triangular shape. The lower one of these embraces the vessel, A, and<br>
those nerves of the brachial plexus, I, which are in contact with it.<br>
The posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, K, and the anterior<br>
scalenus muscle, N, form the sides and apex of this lesser triangular<br>
space, while the horizontal clavicle forms its base. This region of the<br>
subclavian artery is well defined in the necks of most subjects,<br>
especially when the muscles are put in action. In lean but muscular<br>
bodies, it is possible to feel the projection of the anterior scalenus<br>
muscle under the skin, external to the sterno-mastoid. The form of the<br>
omo-hyoid is also to be distinguished in the like bodies. But in all<br>
subjects may be readily recognised that hollow which occurs above the<br>
clavicle, and between the trapezius, 8, and the sterno cleido-mastoid, 7<br>
B, in the centre of which hollow the artery lies.<br>
<br>
The contents of the larger posterior cervical triangle, formed by B, the<br>
sterno-mastoid before; 9, the splenius; and 8, the trapezius behind,<br>
and by the clavicle below, are the following mentioned structures--viz.,<br>
A, the subclavian artery, in the third part of its course, as it emerges<br>
from behind N, the scalenus anticus; L, the transversalis colli artery,<br>
a branch of the thyroid axis, which will be found to cross the<br>
subclavian vessel at this region; I, the brachial plexus of nerves,<br>
which lie external to and above the vessel; H, the external jugular<br>
vein, which sometimes, in conjunction with a plexus of veins coming from<br>
behind the trapezius muscle, entirely conceals the artery; M, the<br>
posterior scapular artery, a branch of the subclavian, given off from<br>
the vessel after it has passed from behind the scalenus muscle; O,<br>
numerous lymphatic glands; P, superficial descending branches of the<br>
cervical plexus of nerves; and Q, ascending superficial branches of the<br>
same plexus. All these structures, except some of the lymphatic glands,<br>
are concealed by the platysma myoides A, as seen in Plate 3, and beneath<br>
this by the cervical fascia, which latter shall be hereafter more<br>
clearly represented.<br>
<br>
In somewhat the same mode as the posterior half of the omo-hyoid<br>
subdivides the larger posterior triangle into two of lesser dimensions,<br>
the anterior half of the same muscle divides the anterior triangle into<br>
two of smaller capacity.<br>
<br>
The great anterior triangle, which is marked as that space inclosed<br>
within the points, 6, the top of the sternum, the mental symphysis and<br>
the angle of the maxilla; and whose sides are marked by the median line<br>
of the neck before, the sterno-mastoid behind, and the ramus of the jaw<br>
above, contains C, the common carotid artery, becoming superficial from<br>
beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, and dividing into E, the internal<br>
carotid, and D, the external carotid. The anterior jugular vein, 3, also<br>
occupies this region below; while some venous branches, which join the<br>
external and internal jugular veins, traverse it in all directions, and<br>
present obstacles to the operator from their meshy plexiform arrangement<br>
yielding, when divided, a profuse haemorrhage.<br>
<br>
The precise locality at which the common carotid appears from under the<br>
sterno-mastoid muscle is, in almost all instances, opposite to the<br>
thyroid cartilage. At this place, if an incision, dividing the skin,<br>
platysma and some superficial branches of nerves, be made along the<br>
anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and this latter be turned<br>
a little aside, a process of cervical fascia, and beneath it the sheath<br>
of the carotid artery, will successionally disclose themselves. In many<br>
bodies, however, some degree of careful search requires to be made prior<br>
to the full exposure of the vessel in its sheath, in consequence of a<br>
considerable quantity of adipose tissue, some lymphatic glands, and many<br>
small veins lying in the immediate vicinity of the carotid artery and<br>
internal jugular vein. This latter vessel, though usually lying<br>
completely concealed by the sterno-mastoid muscle, is frequently to be<br>
seen projecting from under its fore part. In emaciated bodies, where the<br>
sterno-mastoid presents wasted proportions, it will, in consequence,<br>
leave both the main blood-vessels uncovered at this locality in the<br>
neck.<br>
<br>
The common carotid artery ascends the cervical region almost<br>
perpendicularly from opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation to the<br>
greater cornu of the os hyoides. For the greater part of this extent it<br>
is covered by the sterno-mastoid muscle; but as this latter takes an<br>
oblique course backwards to its insertion into the mastoid process,<br>
while the main blood-vessel dividing into branches still ascends in its<br>
original direction, so is it that the artery becomes uncovered by the<br>
muscle. Even the root of the internal carotid, E, may be readily reached<br>
at this place, where it lies on the same plane as the external carotid,<br>
but concealed in great part by the internal jugular vein. It would be<br>
possible, while relaxing the sterno-mastoid muscle, to compress either<br>
the common carotid artery or its main branches against the cervical<br>
vertebral column, if pressure were made in a direction backwards and<br>
inwards. The facial artery V, which springs from the external carotid,<br>
D, may be compressed against the horizontal ramus of the lower jaw-bone<br>
at the anterior border of the masseter muscle. The temporal artery, as<br>
it ascends over the root of the zygoma, may be compressed effectually<br>
against this bony point.<br>
<br>
The external jugular vein, H, Plate 4, as it descends the neck from the<br>
angle of the jaw obliquely backwards over the sterno-mastoid muscle, may<br>
be easily compressed and opened in any part of its course. This vein<br>
courses downwards upon the neck in relation to that branch of the<br>
superficial cervical plexus, named auricularis magnus nerve, Q, Plate 4,<br>
G, Plate 3. The nerve is generally situated behind the vein, to which it<br>
lies sometimes in close proximity, and is liable, therefore, to be<br>
accidentally injured in the performance of phlebotomy upon the external<br>
jugular vein. The coats of the external jugular vein, E, Plate 3, are<br>
said to hold connexion with some of the fibres of the platysma-myoides<br>
muscle, A A, Plate 3, and that therefore, if the vessel be divided<br>
transversely, the two orifices will remain patent for a time.<br>
<br>
The position of the carotid artery protects the vessel, in some degree,<br>
against the suicidal act, as generally attempted. The depth of the<br>
incision necessary to reach the main blood-vessels from the fore part of<br>
the neck is so considerable that the wound seldom effects more than the<br>
opening of some part of the larynx. The ossified condition of the<br>
thyroid and cricoid parts of the laryngeal apparatus affords a<br>
protection to the vessels. The more oblique the incision happens to be,<br>
the greater probability is there that the wound is comparatively<br>
superficial, owing to the circumstance of the instrument having<br>
encountered one or more parts of the hyo-laryngeal range; but woeful<br>
chance sometimes directs the weapon horizontally through that membranous<br>
interval between the thyroid and hyoid pieces, in which case, as also in<br>
that where the laryngeal pieces persist permanently cartilaginous, the<br>
resistance to the cutting instrument is much less.<br>
<br>
The anatomical position of the parotid, H, Plate 3, and submaxillary<br>
glands, W, Plate 4, is so important, that their extirpation, while in a<br>
state of disease, will almost unavoidably concern other principal<br>
structures. Whether the diseased parotid gland itself or a lymphatic<br>
body lying in connexion with it, be the subject of operation, it seldom<br>
happens that the temporo-maxillary branch of the external carotid, F,<br>
escapes the knife. But an accident, much more liable to occur, and one<br>
which produces a great inconvenience afterwards to the subject, is that<br>
of dividing the portio-dura nerve, S, Plate 4, at its exit from the<br>
stylo-mastoid foramen, the consequence being that almost all the muscles<br>
of facial expression become paralyzed. The masseter, L, Plate 3,<br>
pterygoid, buccinator, 15, Plate 4, and the facial fibres of the<br>
platysma muscles, A O, Plate 3, still, however, preserve their power, as<br>
these structures are innervated from a different source. The orbicularis<br>
oculi muscle, which is principally supplied by the portio-dura nerve, is<br>
paralyzed, though it still retains a partial power of contraction, owing<br>
to the anatomical fact that some terminal twigs of the third or motor<br>
pair of nerves of the orbit branch into this muscle.<br>
<br>
The facial artery, V, and the facial vein, U, Plate 4, are in close<br>
connexion with the submaxillary gland. Oftentimes they traverse the<br>
substance of it. The lingual nerve and artery lie in some part of their<br>
course immediately beneath the gland. The former two are generally<br>
divided when the gland is excised; the latter two are liable to be<br>
wounded in the same operation.<br>
