COMMENTARY ON PLATES 65 &amp; 66.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE POPLITEAL SPACE<br>
AND THE POSTERIOR CRURAL REGION.<br>
<br>
On comparing the bend of the knee with the bend of the elbow, as evident<br>
a correspondence can be discerned between these two regions, as exists<br>
between the groin and the axilla.<br>
<br>
Behind the knee-joint, the muscles which connect the leg with the thigh<br>
enclose the space named popliteal. When the integuments and subcutaneous<br>
substance are removed from this place, the dense fascia lata may be seen<br>
binding these muscles so closely together as to leave but a very narrow<br>
interval between them at the mesial line. On removing this fascia, B B M<br>
M, Plate 65, the muscles part asunder, and the popliteal space as<br>
usually described is thereby formed. This region now presents of a<br>
lozenge-shaped form, B J D K, of which the widest diameter, D J, is<br>
opposite the knee-joint. The flexor muscles, C D J, in diverging from<br>
each other as they pass down from the sides of the thigh to those of the<br>
upper part of the leg, form the upper angle of this space; whilst its<br>
lower angle is described by the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, E<br>
E, arising inside the flexors, from the condyles of the femur. The<br>
popliteal space is filled with adipose substance, in which are embedded<br>
several lymphatic bodies and through which pass the principal vessels<br>
and nerves to the leg.<br>
<br>
In the dissection of the popliteal space, the more important parts first<br>
met with are the branches of the great sciatic nerve. In the upper angle<br>
of the space, this nerve will be found dividing into the peronaeal, I,<br>
and posterior tibial branches, H K. The peronaeal nerve descends close<br>
to the inner margin of the tendon, J, of the biceps muscle; and, having<br>
reached the outer side of the knee, I*, Plate 66, below the insertion of<br>
the tendon into the head of the fibula, winds round the neck of this<br>
bone under cover of the peronaeus longus muscle, S, to join the anterior<br>
tibial artery. The posterior tibial nerve, H K, Plate 65, descends the<br>
popliteal space midway to the cleft between the heads of the<br>
gastrocnemius; and, after passing beneath this muscle, to gain the inner<br>
side of the vessels, H*, Plate 66, it then accompanies the posterior<br>
tibial artery. On the same plane with and close to the posterior tibial<br>
nerve in the popliteal space, will be seen the terminal branch of the<br>
lesser sciatic nerve, together with a small artery and vein destined for<br>
distribution to the skin and other superficial parts on the back of the<br>
knee. Opposite the heads of the gastrocnemius, the peronaeal and<br>
posterior tibial nerves give off each a branch, both of which descend<br>
along the mesial line of the calf, and joining near the upper end of the<br>
tendo Achillis, the single nerve here, N, Plate 65, becomes superficial<br>
to the fascia, and thence descends behind the outer ankle to gain the<br>
external border of the foot, where it divides into cutaneous branches<br>
and others to be distributed to the three or four outer toes. In company<br>
with this nerve will be seen the posterior saphena vein, L, which,<br>
commencing behind the outer ankle, ascends the mesial line of the calf<br>
to join the popliteal vein, G, in the cleft between the heads of the<br>
gastrocnemius.<br>
<br>
On removing next the adipose substance and lymphatic glands, we expose<br>
the popliteal vein and artery. The relative position of these vessels<br>
and the posterior tibial nerve, may now be seen. Between the heads of<br>
the gastrocnemius, the nerve, H, giving off large branches to this<br>
muscle, lies upon the popliteal vein, G, where this is joined by the<br>
posterior saphena vein. Beneath the veins lies the popliteal artery, F.<br>
On tracing the vessels and nerve from this point upwards through the<br>
popliteal space, we find the nerve occupying a comparatively superficial<br>
position at the mesial line, while the vessels are directed upwards,<br>
forwards, and inwards, passing deeply, as they become covered by the<br>
inner flexor muscles, C D, to the place where they perforate the tendon<br>
of the adductor magnus on the inner side of the lower third of the<br>
femur.<br>
<br>
The popliteal artery, F, Plate 66, being the continuation of the<br>
femoral, extends from the opening in the great adductor tendon at the<br>
junction of the middle and lower third of the thigh, to the point where<br>
it divides, in the upper, and back part of the leg, at the lower border<br>
of the popliteus muscle, L, into the anterior and posterior tibial<br>
branches. In order to expose the vessel through this extent, we have to<br>
divide and reflect the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, E E, and to<br>
retract the inner flexors. The popliteal artery will now be seen lying<br>
obliquely over the middle of the back of the joint. It is deeply placed<br>
in its whole course. Its upper and lower thirds are covered by large<br>
muscles; whilst the fascia and a quantity of adipose tissue overlies its<br>
middle. The upper part of the artery rests upon the femur, its middle<br>
part upon the posterior ligament of the joint, and its lower part upon<br>
the popliteus muscle. The popliteal vein, G; adheres to the artery in<br>
its whole course, being situated on its outer side above, and posterior<br>
to it below. The vein is not unfrequently found to be double; one vein<br>
lying to either side of the artery, and both having branches of<br>
communication with each other, which cross behind the artery. In some<br>
instances the posterior saphena vein, instead of joining the popliteal<br>
vein, ascends superficially to terminate in some of the large veins of<br>
the thigh. Numerous lymphatic vessels accompany the superficial and deep<br>
veins into the popliteal space, where they join the lymphatic bodies,<br>
which here lie in the course of the artery.<br>
<br>
The branches derived from the popliteal artery are the muscular and the<br>
articular. The former spring from the vessel opposite those parts of the<br>
several muscles which lie in contact with it; the latter are generally<br>
five in number--two superior, two inferior, and one median. The two<br>
superior articular branches arise from either side of the artery, and<br>
pass, the one beneath the outer, the other beneath the inner flexors,<br>
above the knee-joint; and the two inferior pass off from it, the one<br>
internally, the other externally, beneath the heads of the gastrocnemius<br>
below the joint; while the middle articular enters the joint through the<br>
posterior ligament. The two superior and inferior articular branches<br>
anastomose freely around the knee behind, laterally, and in front, where<br>
they are joined by the terminal branches of the anastomotic, from the<br>
femoral, and by those of the recurrent, from the anterior tibial. The<br>
main vessel, having arrived at the lower border of the popliteus muscle,<br>
divides into two branches, of which one passes through the interosseous<br>
ligament to become the anterior tibial; while the other, after<br>
descending a short way between the bones of the leg, separates into the<br>
peronaeal and posterior tibial arteries. In some rare instances the<br>
popliteal artery is found to divide above the popliteus muscle into the<br>
anterior, or the posterior tibial, or the peronaeal.<br>
<br>
The two large muscles, (gastrocnemius and soleus,) forming the calf of<br>
the leg, have to be removed together with the deep fascia in order to<br>
expose the posterior tibial, and peronaeal vessels and nerves. The<br>
fascia forms a sheath for the vessels, and binds them close to the deep<br>
layer of muscles in their whole course down the back of the leg. The<br>
point at which the main artery, F, Plate 66, gives off the anterior<br>
tibial, is at the lower border of the popliteus muscle, on a level with<br>
N, the neck of the fibula; that at which the artery again subdivides<br>
into the peronaeal, P, and posterior tibial branches, O, is in the<br>
mesial line of the leg, and generally on a level with the junction of<br>
its upper and middle thirds. From this place the two arteries diverge in<br>
their descent; the peronaeal being directed along the inner border of<br>
the fibula towards the back of the outer ankle; while the posterior<br>
tibial, approaching the inner side of the tibia, courses towards the<br>
back of the inner ankle. The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles overlie<br>
both arteries in their upper two thirds; but as these muscles taper<br>
towards the mesial line where they end in the tendo Achillis, V V, Plate<br>
65, they leave the posterior tibial artery, O, with its accompanying<br>
nerve and vein, uncovered in the lower part of the leg, except by the<br>
skin and the superficial and deep layers of fasciae. The peronaeal<br>
artery is deeply situated in its whole course. Soon after its origin, it<br>
passes under cover of the flexor longus pollicis, R, a muscle of large<br>
size arising from the lower three fourths of the fibula, N, and will be<br>
found overlapped by this muscle on the outer border of the tendo<br>
Achillis, as low down as the outer ankle. The two arteries are<br>
accompanied by venae comites, which, with the short saphena vein, form<br>
the popliteal vein. The posterior tibial artery is closely followed by<br>
the posterior tibial nerve. In the popliteal space, this nerve crosses<br>
to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery, where both are about<br>
to pass under the gastrocnemius muscle, to which they give large<br>
branches. Near the middle of the leg, the nerve recrosses the artery to<br>
its outer side and in this relative position both descend to a point<br>
about midway between the inner ankle and calcaneum, where they appear<br>
having the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum<br>
to their inner side and the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis on<br>
their outer side. Numerous branches are given off from the nerve and<br>
artery to the neighbouring parts in their course.<br>
<br>
The varieties of the posterior crural arteries are these--the tibial<br>
vessel, in some instances, is larger than usual, while the peronaeal is<br>
small, or absent; and, in others, the peronaeal supplies the place of<br>
the posterior tibial, when the latter is diminished in size. The<br>
peronaeal has been known to take the position of the posterior tibial in<br>
the lower part of the leg, and to supply the plantar arteries. In<br>
whatever condition the two vessels may be found, there will always be<br>
seen ramifying around the ankle-joint, articular branches, which<br>
anastomose freely with each other and with those of the anterior tibial.<br>
<br>
<br>
The popliteal artery is unfavourably circumstanced for the application<br>
of a ligature. It is very deeply situated, and the vein adheres closely<br>
to its posterior surface. Numerous branches (articular and muscular)<br>
arise from it at short intervals; and these, besides being a source of<br>
disturbance to a ligature, are liable to be injured in the operation, in<br>
which case the collateral circulation cannot be maintained after the<br>
main vessel is tied. There is a danger, too, of injuring the middle<br>
branch of the sciatic nerve, in the incisions required to reach the<br>
artery; and, lastly, there is a possibility of this vessel dividing<br>
higher up than usual. Considering these facts in reference to those<br>
cases in which it might be supposed necessary to tie the popliteal<br>
artery--such cases, for example, as aneurism of either of the crural<br>
arteries, or secondary haemorrhages occurring after amputations of the<br>
leg at a time when the healing process was far advanced and the bleeding<br>
vessels inaccessible,--it becomes a question whether it would not be<br>
preferable to tie the femoral, rather than the popliteal artery. But<br>
when the popliteal artery itself becomes affected with aneurism, and<br>
when, in addition to the anatomical circumstances which forbid the<br>
application of a ligature to this vessel, we consider those which are<br>
pathological,--such as the coats of the artery being here diseased, the<br>
relative position of the neighbouring parts being disturbed by the<br>
tumour, and the large irregular wound which would be required to isolate<br>
the disease, at the risk of danger to the health from profuse<br>
suppuration, to the limb from destruction of the collateral branches, or<br>
to the joint from cicatrization, rendering it permanently bent,--we must<br>
acknowledge at once the necessity for tying the femoral part of the main<br>
vessel.<br>
<br>
When the popliteal artery happens to be divided in a wound, it will be<br>
required to expose its bleeding orifices, and tie both these in the<br>
wound. For this purpose, the following operation usually recommended for<br>
reaching the vessel may be necessary. The skin and fascia lata are to be<br>
incised in a direction corresponding to that of the vessel. The extent<br>
of the incision must be considerable, (about three inches,) so as the<br>
more conveniently to expose the artery in its deep situation. On laying<br>
bare the outer margin of the semi-membranosus muscle, while the knee is<br>
straight, it now becomes necessary to flex the joint, in order that this<br>
muscle may admit of being pressed inwards from over the vessel. The<br>
external margin of the wound, including the middle branch of the sciatic<br>
nerve, should be retracted outwards, so as to ensure the safety of that<br>
nerve, while room is gained for making the deeper incisions. The adipose<br>
substance, which is here generally abundant, should now be divided,<br>
between the mesial line and the semimembranosus, till the sheath of<br>
the vessels be exposed. The sheath should be incised at its inner side,<br>
to avoid wounding the popliteal vein. The pulsation of the artery will<br>
now indicate its exact position. As the vein adheres firmly to the coats<br>
of the artery, some care is required to separate the two vessels, so as<br>
to pass the ligature around each end of the artery from without inwards,<br>
while excluding the vein. While this operation is being performed in a<br>
case of wound of the popliteal artery, the haemorrhage may be arrested<br>
by compressing the femoral vessel, either against the femur or the os<br>
pubis.<br>
<br>
In the operation for tying the posterior tibial artery near its middle,<br>
an incision of three or four inches in extent is to be made through the<br>
skin and fascia, in a line corresponding with the inner posterior margin<br>
of the tibia and the great muscles of the calf. The long saphena vein<br>
should be here avoided. The origins of the gastrocnemius and soleus<br>
muscles require to be detached from the tibia, and then the knee is to<br>
be flexed and the foot extended, so as to allow these muscles to be<br>
retracted from the plane of the vessels. This being done, the deep<br>
fascia which covers the artery and its accompanying nerve is next to be<br>
divided. The artery will now appear pulsating at a situation an inch<br>
from the edge of the tibia. While the ligature is being passed around<br>
the artery, due care should be taken to exclude the venae comites and<br>
the nerve.<br>
