<br>
CONCLUDING COMMENTARY.<br>
ON THE FORM AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.<br>
ANOMALIES.--RAMIFICATION.--ANASTOMOSIS.<br>
<br>
<br>
I.--The heart, in all stages of its development, is to the vascular<br>
system what the point of a circle is to the circumference--namely, at<br>
once <span style="font-style: italic;">the beginning and the end.</span>
The heart, occupying, it may be said,<br>
the centre of the thorax, circulates the blood in the same way, by<br>
similar channels, to an equal extent, in equal pace, and at the same<br>
period of time, through both sides of the body. In its adult normal<br>
condition, the heart presents itself as a double or symmetrical organ.<br>
The two hearts, though united and appearing single, are nevertheless, as<br>
to their respective cavities, absolutely distinct. Each heart consists<br>
again of two compartments--an auricle and a ventricle. The two auricles<br>
are similar in structure and form. The two ventricles are similar in the<br>
same respects. A septum divides the two auricles, and another--the two<br>
ventricles. Between the right auricle and ventricle, forming the right<br>
heart, there exists a valvular apparatus (tricuspid), by which these two<br>
compartments communicate; and a similar valve (bicuspid) admits of<br>
communication between the left auricle and ventricle. The two hearts<br>
being distinct, and the main vessels arising from each respectively<br>
being distinct likewise, it follows that the capillary peripheries of<br>
these vessels form the only channels through which the blood issuing<br>
from one heart can enter the other.<br>
<br>
II.--As the aorta of the left heart ramifies throughout all parts of the<br>
body, and as the countless ramifications of this vessel terminate in an<br>
equal number of ramifications of the principal veins of the right heart,<br>
it will appear that between the systemic vessels of the two hearts<br>
respectively, the capillary anastomotic circulation reigns <span
 style="font-style: italic;">universal.</span><br>
<br>
III.--The body generally is marked by the median line, from the vertex<br>
to the perinaeum, into corresponding halves. All parts excepting the<br>
main bloodvessels in the neighbourhood of the heart are naturally<br>
divisible by this line into equals. The vessels of each heart, in being<br>
distributed to both sides of the body alike, cross each other at the<br>
median line, and hence they are inseparable according to this line,<br>
unless by section. If the vessels proper to each heart, right and left,<br>
ramified alone within the limits of their respective sides of the body,<br>
then their capillary anastomosis could only take place along the median<br>
line, and here in such case they might be separated by median section<br>
into two distinct systems. But as each system is itself double in<br>
branching into both sides of the body, the two would be at the same time<br>
equally divided by vertical section. From this it will appear that the<br>
vessels belonging to <span style="font-style: italic;">each</span>
heart form a symmetrical system, corresponding<br>
to the sides of the body, and that the capillary anastomosis of these<br>
systemic veins and arteries is divisible into <span
 style="font-style: italic;">two great fields</span>, one<br>
situated on either side of the median line, and touching at this line.<br>
<br>
IV.--The vessels of the right heart do not communicate at their<br>
capillary peripheries, for its veins are systemic, and its arteries are<br>
pulmonary. The vessels of the left heart do not anastomose, for its<br>
veins are pulmonary, and its arteries are systemic. The arteries of the<br>
right and left hearts cannot anastomose, for the former are pulmonary,<br>
and the latter are systemic; and neither can the veins of the right and<br>
left hearts, for a similar reason. Hence, therefore, there can be,<br>
between the vessels of both hearts, but <span
 style="font-style: italic;">two provinces of</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">anastomosis</span>--viz., that of the
lungs, and that of the system. In the<br>
lungs, the arteries of the right heart and the veins of the left<br>
anastomose. In the body generally (not excepting the lungs), the<br>
arteries of the left heart, and the veins of the right, anastomose; and<br>
thus in the pulmonary and the systemic circulation, each heart plays an<br>
equal part through the medium of its proper vessels. The pulmonary bear<br>
to the systemic vessels the same relation as a lesser circle contained<br>
within a greater; and the vessels of each heart form the half of each<br>
circle, the arteries of the one being opposite the veins of the other.<br>
<br>
V.--The two hearts being, by the union of their similar forms, as one<br>
organ in regard to place, act, by an agreement of their corresponding<br>
functions, as one organ in respect to time. The action of the auricles<br>
is synchronous; that of the ventricles is the same; that of the auricles<br>
and ventricles is consentaneous; and that of the whole heart is<br>
rhythmical, or harmonious--the diastole of the auricles occurring in<br>
harmonical time with the systole of the ventricles, and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">vice versa</span>. By<br>
this correlative action of both hearts, the pulmonary and systemic<br>
circulations take place synchronously; and the phenomena resulting in<br>
both reciprocate and balance each other. In the pulmonary circulation,<br>
the blood is aerated, decarbonized, and otherwise depurated; whilst in<br>
the systemic circulation, it is carbonized and otherwise deteriorated.<br>
<br>
VI.--The circulation through the lungs and the system is carried on<br>
through vessels having the following form and relative position, which,<br>
as being most usual, is accounted normal. The two brachio-cephalic veins<br>
joining at the root of the neck, and the two common iliac veins joining<br>
in front of the lumbar vertebrae, form the superior and inferior venae<br>
cavae, by which the blood is returned from the upper and lower parts of<br>
the body to the right auricle, and thence it enters the right ventricle,<br>
by which it is impelled through the pulmonary artery into the two lungs;<br>
and from these it is returned (aerated) by the pulmonary veins to the<br>
left auricle, which passes it into the left ventricle, and by this it is<br>
impelled through the systemic aorta, which branches throughout the body<br>
in a similar way to the systemic veins, with which the aortic branches<br>
anastomose generally. On viewing together the system of vessels proper<br>
to each heart, they will be seen to exhibit in respect to the body a<br>
figure in doubly symmetrical arrangement, of which the united hearts<br>
form a duplex centre. At this centre, which is the theatre of<br>
metamorphosis, the principal abnormal conditions of the bloodvessels<br>
appear; and in order to find the signification of these, we must retrace<br>
the stages of development.<br>
<br>
VII.--From the first appearance of an individualized centre in the<br>
vascular area of the human embryo, that centre (punctum saliens) and the<br>
vessels immediately connected with it, undergo a phaseal metamorphosis,<br>
till such time after birth as they assume their permanent character. In<br>
each stage of metamorphosis, the embryo heart and vessels typify the<br>
normal condition of the organ in one of the lower classes of animals.<br>
The several species of the organ in these classes are parallel to the<br>
various stages of change in the human organ. In its earliest condition,<br>
the human heart presents the form of a simple canal, similar to that of<br>
the lower Invertebrata, the veins being connected with its posterior<br>
end, while from its anterior end a single artery emanates. The canal<br>
next assumes a bent shape, and the vessels of both its ends become<br>
thereby approximated. The canal now being folded upon itself in<br>
heart-shape, next becomes constricted in situations, marking out the<br>
future auricle and ventricle and arterial bulb, which still communicate<br>
with each other. From the artery are given off on either side<br>
symmetrically five branches (branchial arches), which arch laterally<br>
from before, outwards and backwards, and unite in front of the<br>
vertebrae, forming the future descending aorta. In this condition, the<br>
human heart and vessels resemble the Piscean pipe. The next changes<br>
which take place consist in the gradual subdivision, by means of septa,<br>
of the auricle and ventricle respectively into two cavities. On the<br>
separation of the single auricle into two, while the ventricle as yet<br>
remains single, the heart presents that condition which is proper to the<br>
Reptilian class. The interauricular and interventricular septa, by<br>
gradual development from without inwards, at length meet and coalesce,<br>
thereby dividing the two cavities into four--two auricles and two<br>
ventricles--a condition proper to the Avian and Mammalian classes<br>
generally. In the centre of the interauricular septum of the human<br>
heart, an aperture (<span style="font-style: italic;">foramen ovale</span>)
is left as being necessary to the<br>
foetal circulation. While the septa are being completed, the arterial<br>
bulb also becomes divided by a partition formed in its interior in such<br>
a manner as to adjust the two resulting arteries, the one in connexion<br>
with the right, the other with the left ventricle. The right ventricular<br>
artery (pulmonary aorta) so formed, has assigned to it the fifth<br>
(posterior) opposite pair of arches, and of these the right one<br>
remaining pervious to the point where it gives off the right pulmonary<br>
branch, becomes obliterated beyond this point to that where it joins the<br>
descending aorta, while the left arch remains pervious during foetal<br>
life, as the <span style="font-style: italic;">ductus arteriosus </span>still
communicating with the descending<br>
aorta, and giving off at its middle the left pulmonary branch. The left<br>
ventricular artery (systemic aorta) is formed of the fourth arch of the<br>
left side, while the opposite arch (fourth right) is altogether<br>
obliterated. The third and second arches remain pervious on both sides,<br>
afterwards to become the right and left brachio-cephalic arteries. The<br>
first pair of arches, if not converted into the vertebral arteries, or<br>
the thyroid axes, are altogether metamorphosed. By these changes the<br>
heart and primary arteries assume the character in which they usually<br>
present themselves at birth, and in all probability the primary veins<br>
corresponded in form, number, and distribution with the arterial<br>
vessels, and underwent, at the same time, a similar mode of<br>
metamorphosis. One point in respect to the original symmetrical<br>
character of the primary veins is demonstrable--namely, that in front of<br>
the aortic branches the right and left brachio-cephalic veins, after<br>
joining by a cross branch, descend separately on either side of the<br>
heart, and enter (as two superior venae cavae) the right auricle by<br>
distinct orifices. In some of the lower animals, this double condition<br>
of the superior veins is constant, but in the human species the left<br>
vein below the cross branch (left brachio-cephalic) becomes obliterated,<br>
whilst the right vein (vena cava superior) receives the two<br>
brachio-cephalic veins, and in this condition remains throughout life.<br>
After birth, on the commencement of respiration, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">foramen ovale</span> of<br>
the interauricular septum closes, and the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ductus arteriosus</span> becomes<br>
impervious. This completes the stages of metamorphosis, and changes the<br>
course of the simple foetal circulation to one of a more complex<br>
order--viz., the systemic-pulmonary characteristic of the normal state<br>
in the adult body.<br>
<br>
VIII.--Such being the phases of metamorphosis of the primary (branchial)<br>
arches which yield the vessels in their normal adult condition, we<br>
obtain in this history an explanation of the signification not only of<br>
such of their anomalies as are on record, but of such also as are<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">potential</span> in the law of
development; a few of them will suffice to<br>
illustrate the meaning of the whole number:--l<span
 style="font-style: italic;">st</span>, The interventricular<br>
as well as the interauricular septum may be arrested in growth, leaving<br>
an aperture in the centre of each; the former condition is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">natural to</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">the human foetus</span>, the latter <span
 style="font-style: italic;">to the reptilian class,</span> while both
would be<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">abnormal in the human adult. 2nd</span>.
The heart may be <span style="font-style: italic;">cleft at its apex</span>
in<br>
the situation of the interventricular septum--a condition <span
 style="font-style: italic;">natural to the</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dugong</span>, A similar cleavage may
divide the <span style="font-style: italic;">base of the heart</span>
in the<br>
situation of the interauricular septum. 3<span
 style="font-style: italic;">rd</span>. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">partitioning of the</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">bulbus arteriosus</span> may occur in
such a manner as to assign to the two<br>
aortae a relative position, the<span style="font-style: italic;">
reverse</span> of that which they <span style="font-style: italic;">normally</span><br>
occupy--the <span style="font-style: italic;">pulmonary aorta</span>
springing from the <span style="font-style: italic;">left ventricle</span>
and the<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">systemic aorta</span> arising from
the <span style="font-style: italic;">right,</span> and giving off
from its arch the<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">primary branches</span> in the usual
order. [Footnote 1] 4<span style="font-style: italic;">th</span>. As the<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> two aortae</span><br>
result from a <span style="font-style: italic;">division</span> of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">common primary vessel (bulbus
arteriosus)</span>,<br>
an <span style="font-style: italic;">arrest </span>in the growth of
the partition would leave them still as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">one</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">vessel</span>, which (supposing the
ventricular septum remained also<br>
incomplete) would then arise from a <span style="font-style: italic;">single
ventricle</span>. 5<span style="font-style: italic;">th.</span> The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ductus</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">arteriosus</span> may remain <span
 style="font-style: italic;">pervious</span>, and while co-existing
with the proper<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">aortic arch, two arches</span> would
then appear on the <span style="font-style: italic;">left side</span>.
6<span style="font-style: italic;">th</span>. The<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">systemic normal aortic arch</span>
may be obliterated as far up as the<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">innominate branch</span>, and while
the <span style="font-style: italic;">ductus arteriosus</span> remains
<span style="font-style: italic;">pervious,</span> and<br>
leading from the pulmonary artery to the descending part of the aortic<br>
arch, this vessel would then present the appearance of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a branch</span><br>
ascending from the left side and giving off the brachio-cephalic<br>
arteries. The <span style="font-style: italic;">right ventricular
artery</span> would then, through the medium of<br>
the <span style="font-style: italic;">ductus arteriosus</span>, supply
both the lungs and the system. Such a<br>
state of the vessels would require (in order that the circulation of a<br>
mixed blood might be carried on) that the two ventricles freely<br>
communicate. 7<span style="font-style: italic;">th</span>. If the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">fourth arch</span> of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">right side</span> remained pervious<br>
opposite the <span style="font-style: italic;">proper aortic arch</span>,
there would exist <span style="font-style: italic;">two aortic arches</span><br>
placed <span style="font-style: italic;">symmetrically</span>, one on
either side of the vertebral column, and,<br>
joining below, would <span style="font-style: italic;">include in
their circle</span> the trachea and oesophagus.<br>
8th. If the <span style="font-style: italic;">fifth arch</span> of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">right side</span> remained <span
 style="font-style: italic;">pervious</span> opposite the<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">open ductus arteriosus</span>, both
vessels would present a similar<br>
arrangement, as <span style="font-style: italic;">two symmetrical
ducti arteriosi </span>co-existing with<br>
symmetrical aortic arches. 9<span style="font-style: italic;">th</span>.
If the vessels appeared <span style="font-style: italic;">co-existing</span>
in<br>
the <span style="font-style: italic;">two conditions</span> last
mentioned, they would represent <span style="font-style: italic;">four
aortic</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">arches, two on either side of the
vertebral column.</span> 10<span style="font-style: italic;">th</span>.
If the <span style="font-style: italic;">fourth</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">right arch, instead of the fourth left</span>
(aorta), remained <span style="font-style: italic;">pervious</span>,
the<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">systemic aortic arch </span>would
then be turned to the <span style="font-style: italic;">right side</span>
of the<br>
vertebral column, and have the trachea and oesophagus on its <span
 style="font-style: italic;">left</span>. 11<span
 style="font-style: italic;">th.</span><br>
When the <span style="font-style: italic;">bulbus arteriosus</span>
divides itself into <span style="font-style: italic;">three parts</span>,
the <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">lateral parts</span>, in becoming
connected with the <span style="font-style: italic;">left ventricle</span>,
will<br>
represent a <span style="font-style: italic;">double ascending
systemic aorta</span>, and having the <span style="font-style: italic;">pulmonary</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">artery</span> passing <span
 style="font-style: italic;">between them</span> to the lungs. 12<span
 style="font-style: italic;">th</span>. When of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">two original</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">superior venae cavae</span> the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">right one</span> instead of the left
suffers<br>
metamorphosis, the <span style="font-style: italic;">vena cava superior</span>
will then appear on the <span style="font-style: italic;">left side</span><br>
of the <span style="font-style: italic;">normal aortic arch.</span>
[Footnote 2] Of these malformations, some are<br>
rather frequently met with, others very seldom, and others cannot exist<br>
compatible with life after birth. Those which involve a more or less<br>
imperfect discharge of the blood-aerating functions of the lungs, are in<br>
those degrees more or less fatal, and thus nature aborting as to the<br>
fitness of her creation, cancels it.<br>
<br>
[Footnote 1: This physiological truth has, I find, been applied by Dr.<br>
R. Quain to the explanation of a numerous class of malformations<br>
connected with the origins of the great vessels from the heart, and of<br>
their primary branches. See <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Lancet</span>, vol. I. 1842.]<br>
<br>

primary veins in the human subject, see an able and original monograph<br>
in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Philosophical Transactions,</span>

Development of the Great Anterior Veins in Man and Mammalia." By John<br>
Marshall, F.R.C.S., &amp;c. ]<br>
<br>
<br>
IX.--The <span style="font-style: italic;">portal system of veins </span>passing
<span style="font-style: italic;">to</span> the liver, and the hepatic<br>
veins passing <span style="font-style: italic;">from</span> this organ
to join the inferior vena cava, exhibit in<br>
respect to the median line of the body an example of a-symmetry, since<br>
appearing on the right side, they have no counterparts on the left. As<br>
the law of symmetry seems to prevail universally in the development of<br>
organized beings, forasmuch as every lateral organ or part has its<br>
counterpart, while every central organ is double or complete, in having<br>
two similar sides, then the portal system, as being an exception to this<br>
law, is as a natural note of interrogation questioning the signification<br>
of that fact, and in the following observations, it appears to me, the<br>
answer may be found. Every artery in the body has its companion vein or<br>
veins. The inferior vena cava passes sidelong with the aorta in the<br>
abdomen. Every branch of the aorta which ramifies upon the abdominal<br>
parietes has its accompanying vein returning either to the vena cava or<br>
the vena azygos, and entering either of these vessels at a point on the<br>
same level as that at which itself arises. The renal vessels also have<br>
this arrangement. But all the other veins of the abdominal viscera,<br>
instead of entering the vena cava opposite their corresponding arteries,<br>
unite into a single trunk (vena portae), which enters the liver. The<br>
special purpose of this destination of the portal system is obvious, but<br>
the function of a part gives no explanation of its form or relative<br>
position, whether singular or otherwise. On viewing the vessels in<br>
presence of the general law of symmetrical development, it occurs to me<br>
that the <span style="font-style: italic;">portal</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">hepatic veins form one continuous system</span>,
which<br>
taken in <span style="font-style: italic;">the totality</span>,
represents the <span style="font-style: italic;">companion veins of
the arteries of</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">the abdominal viscera.</span> The
liver under this interpretation appears as a<br>
gland <span style="font-style: italic;">developed midway</span> upon
these veins, and <span style="font-style: italic;">dismembering them</span>
into a<br>
mesh of countless capillary vessels, (a condition necessary for all<br>
processes of secretion,) for the special purpose of decarbonizing the<br>
blood. In this great function the liver is an organ correlative or<br>
compensative to the lungs, whose office is similar. The secretion of the<br>
liver (bile) is fluidform; that of the lungs is aeriform. The bile being<br>
necessary to the digestive process, the liver has a duct to convey that<br>
product of its secretion to the intestines. The trachea is as it were<br>
the duct of the lungs. In the liver, then,<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> the portal</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">hepatic veins</span><br>
being continuous <span style="font-style: italic;">as veins,</span>
the two systems, notwithstanding their<br>
apparent distinctness, caused by the intervention of the hepatic<br>
lobules, may be regarded as the <span style="font-style: italic;">veins
corresponding with the arteries of</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">the coeliac axis, and the two
mesenteric. </span>The hepatic artery and the<br>
hepatic veins evidently do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
pair in the sense of <span style="font-style: italic;">afferent</span>
and<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">efferent,</span> with respect to the
liver, both these vessels having<br>
destinations as different as those of the bronchial artery and the<br>
pulmonary veins in the lungs. The bronchial artery is attended by its<br>
vein proper, while the vein which corresponds to the hepatic artery<br>
joins either the hepatic or portal veins traversing the liver, and in<br>
this position escapes notice.[Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: In instancing these facts, as serving under comparison to<br>
explain how the hepatic vessels constitute no <span
 style="font-style: italic;">radical </span>exception to the<br>
law of symmetry which presides over the development and distribution of<br>
the vascular system as a whole, I am led to inquire in what respect (if<br>
in any) the liver as an organ forms an exception to this general law<br>
either in shape, in function, or in relative position. While seeing that<br>
every central organ is single and symmetrical by the union of two<br>
absolutely similar sides, and that each lateral pair of organs is double<br>
by the disunion of sides so similar to each other in all respects that<br>
the description of either side serves for the other opposite, it has<br>
long since seemed to me a reasonable inference that, since the liver on<br>
the right has no counterpart <span style="font-style: italic;">as a
liver</span> on the left, and that, since the<br>
spleen on the left has no counterpart <span style="font-style: italic;">as
a spleen</span> on the right, so these<br>
two organs (the liver and spleen) must themselves correspond to each<br>
other, and as such, express their respective significations. Under the<br>
belief that every exception (even though it be normal) to a general law<br>
or rule, is, like the anomaly itself, alone explicable according to such<br>
law, and expressing a fact not more singular or isolated from other<br>
parallel facts than is one form from another, or from all others<br>
constituting the graduated scale of being, I would, according to the<br>
light of this evidence alone, have no hesitation in stating that the<br>
liver and spleen, as opposites, represent corresponding organs, even<br>
though they appeared at first view more dissimilar than they really are.<br>
In support of this analogy of both organs, which is here, so far as I am<br>
aware, originally enunciated for anatomical science, I record the<br>
following observations:--1<span style="font-style: italic;">st.</span>
Between the opposite parts of the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span><br>
organic entity (between the opposite leaves of the same plant, for<br>
example), nature manifests no such absolute difference in any case as<br>
exists between the leaf of a plant and of a book. 2<span
 style="font-style: italic;">ndly.</span> When between<br>
two opposite parts of the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span>
organic form there appears any<br>
differential character, this is simply the result of a modification or<br>
metamorphosis of one of the two perfectly similar originals or<br>
archetypes, but never carried out to such an extreme degree as to<br>
annihilate all trace of their analogy. 3<span
 style="font-style: italic;">rdly.</span> The liver and the spleen<br>
are opposite parts; and as such, they are associated by arteries which<br>
arise by a single trunk (coeliac axis) from the aorta, and branch right<br>
and left, like indices pointing to the relationship between both these<br>
organs, in the same manner as the two emulgent arteries point to the<br>
opposite renal organs. 4<span style="font-style: italic;">thly</span>.
The liver is divided into two lobes, right<br>
and left; the left is less than the right; that quantity which is<br>
wanting to the left lobe is equal to the quantity of a spleen; and if in<br>
idea we add the spleen to the left lobe of the liver, both lobes of this<br>
organ become quantitatively equal, and the whole liver symmetrical;<br>
hence, as the liver <span style="font-style: italic;">plus</span> the
spleen represents the whole structural<br>
quantity, so the liver <span style="font-style: italic;">minus</span>
the spleen signifies that the two organs<br>
now dissevered still relate to each other as parts of the same whole.<br>
5<span style="font-style: italic;">thly</span>. The liver, as being <span
 style="font-style: italic;">three-fourths</span> of the whole,
possesses the<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">duct </span>which emanates at the
centre of all glandular bodies. The spleen,<br>
as being <span style="font-style: italic;">one-fourth</span> of the
whole, is <span style="font-style: italic;">devoid</span> of the duct.
The liver<br>
having the duct, is functional as a gland, while the spleen having no<br>
duct, cannot serve any such function. If, in thus indicating the<br>
function which the spleen does <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>possess,
there appears no proof<br>
positive of the function which it <span style="font-style: italic;">does,</span>
perhaps the truth is, that as<br>
being the ductless portion of the whole original hepatic quantity, it<br>
exists as a thing degenerate and functionless, for it seems that the<br>
animal economy suffers no loss of function when deprived of it. 6<span
 style="font-style: italic;">thly.</span><br>
In early foetal life, the left lobe of the liver <span
 style="font-style: italic;">touches</span> the spleen on<br>
the left side; but in the process of abdominal development, the two<br>
organs become separated from each other right and left. 7<span
 style="font-style: italic;">thly.</span> In<br>
animals devoid of the spleen, the liver appears of a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">symmetrical </span>shape,<br>
both its lobes being <span style="font-style: italic;">equal</span>;
for that quantity which in other animals has<br>
become splenic, is in the former still hepatic. 8<span
 style="font-style: italic;">thly</span>. In cases of<br>
transposition of both organs, it is the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">right </span>lobe of the liver--that<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">nearest the spleen,</span> now on the
right side--which is the <span style="font-style: italic;">smaller</span>
of the<br>
two lobes, proving that whichever lobe be in this condition, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">spleen,</span><br>
as being opposite to it, <span style="font-style: italic;">represents
the minus hepatic quantity</span>. From<br>
these, among other facts, I infer that the spleen is the representative<br>
of the liver on the left side, and that as such, its signification being<br>
manifest, there exists no exception to the law of animal symmetry. "Tam<br>
miram uniformitatem in planetarum systemate, necessario fatendum est<br>
intelligentia et concilio fuisse effectam. Idemque dici possit de<br>
uniformitate illa quae est in corporibus animalium. Habent videlicet<br>
animalia pleraque omnia, bina latera, dextrum et sinistrum, forma<br>
consimili: et in lateribus illis, a posteriore quidem corporis sui<br>
parte, pedes binos; ab anteriori autem parte, binos armos, vel pedes,<br>
vel alas, humeris affixos: interque humeros collum, in spinam excurrens,<br>
cui affixum est caput; in eoque capite binas aures, binos oculos, nasum,<br>
os et linguam; similiter posita omnia, in omnibus fere animalibus."<br>

<br>
X.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The heart</span>, though being
itself the recipient, the prime mover, and<br>
the dispenser of the blood, does not depend either for its growth,<br>
vitality, or stimulus to action, upon the blood under these uses, but<br>
upon the blood circulating through vessels which are derived from its<br>
main systemic artery, and disposed in capillary ramifications through<br>
its substance, in the manner of the nutrient vessels of all other
organs.<br>
The two <span style="font-style: italic;">coronary arteries</span> of
the heart arise from the systemic aorta<br>
immediately outside the semilunar valves, situated in the root of this<br>
vessel, and in passing right and left along the auriculo-ventricular<br>
furrows, they send off some branches for the supply of the organ itself,<br>
and others by which both vessels anastomose freely around its base and<br>
apex. The <span style="font-style: italic;">vasa cordis</span> form an
anastomotic circulation altogether<br>
isolated from the vessels of the other thoracic organs, and also from<br>
those distributed to the thoracic parietes. The coronary arteries are<br>
accompanied by veins which open by distinct orifices (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">foramina Thebesii</span>)<br>
into the right auricle. Like the heart itself, its main vessels do not<br>
depend for their support upon the blood conveyed by them, but upon that<br>
circulated by the small arteries (<span style="font-style: italic;">vasa
vasorum</span>) derived either from the<br>
vessel upon which they are distributed, or from some others in the<br>
neighbourhood. These little arteries are attended by veins of a<br>
corresponding size (<span style="font-style: italic;">venules</span>)
which enter the venae comites, thus<br>
carrying out the general order of vascular distribution to the minutest<br>
particular. Besides the larger nerves which accompany the main vessels,<br>
there are delicate filaments of the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic<br>
system distributed to their coats, for the purpose, as it is supposed,<br>
of governing their "contractile movements." The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">vasa vasorum</span> form an<br>
anastomosis as well upon the inner surface of the sheath as upon the<br>
artery contained in this part; and hence in the operation for tying the<br>
vessel, the rule should be to disturb its connexions as little as<br>
possible, otherwise its vitality, which depends upon these minute<br>
branches, will, by their rupture,<span style="font-style: italic;"> be
destroyed in the situation of the</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">ligature, where it is most needed</span>.<br>
<br>
XI.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The branches of the systemic
aorta </span>form frequent anastomoses with<br>
each other in all parts of the body. <span style="font-style: italic;">This
anastomosis occurs chiefly</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">amongst the branches of the main
arteries proper to either side</span>. Those<br>
branches of the opposite vessels which join at the median line are<br>
generally of very small size. There are but few instances in which a<br>
large blood vessel <span style="font-style: italic;">crosses the
central line from its own side to the</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">other</span>. Anastomosis at the
median line between opposite vessels happens<br>
either by a <span style="font-style: italic;">fusion of their sides</span>
lying parallel, as for example (and<br>
the only one) that of the two vertebral arteries on the basilar process<br>
of the occipital bone; or else by a direct <span
 style="font-style: italic;">end-to-end union</span>, of which<br>
the lateral pair of cerebral arteries, forming the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">circle of Willis</span>, and<br>
the two labial arteries, forming the coronary, are examples. The<br>
branches of the main arteries of one side form numerous anastomoses in<br>
the muscles and in the cellular and adipose tissue generally. Other<br>
special branches derived from the parent vessel above and below the<br>
several joints ramify and anastomose so very freely over the surfaces of<br>
these parts, and seem to pass in reference to them out of their direct<br>
course, that to effect this mode of distribution appears to be no less<br>
immediate a design than to support the structures of which the joints<br>
are composed.<br>
<br>
XII.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The innominate artery</span>.
When this vessel is tied, the free direct<br>
circulation through the principal arteries of the right arm, and the<br>
right side of the neck, head, and brain, becomes arrested; and the<br>
degree of strength of the recurrent circulation depends solely upon the<br>
amount of anastomosing points between the following arteries of the<br>
opposite sides. The small terminal branches of the two occipital, the<br>
two auricular, the two superficial temporal, and the two frontal,<br>
inosculate with each other upon the sides, and over the vertex of the<br>
head; the two vertebral, and the branches of the internal carotid, at<br>
the base and over the surface of the brain; the two facial with each<br>
other, and with the frontal above and mental below, at the median line<br>
of the face; the two internal maxillary by their palatine, pharyngeal,<br>
meningeal, and various other branches upon the surface of the parts to<br>
which they are distributed; and lastly, the two superior thyroid<br>
arteries inosculate around the larynx and in the thyroid body. By these<br>
anastomoses, it will be seen that the circulation is restored to the<br>
branches of the common carotid almost solely. In regard to the<br>
subclavian artery, the circulation would be carried on through the<br>
anastomosing branches of the two inferior thyroid in the thyroid body;<br>
of the two vertebral, in the cranium and upon the cervical vertebrae; of<br>
the two internal mammary, with each other behind the sternum, and with<br>
the thoracic branches of the axillary and the superior intercostal<br>
laterally; lastly, through the anastomosis of the ascending cervical<br>
with the descending branch of the occipital, and with the small lateral<br>
offsets of the vertebral.<br>
<br>
XIII.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The common carotid arteries,</span>
Of these two vessels, the left one<br>
arising, in general, from the arch of the aorta, is longer than the<br>
right one by the measure of the innominate artery from which the right<br>
arises. When either of the common carotids is tied, the circulation will<br>
be maintained through the anastomosing branches of the opposite vessels<br>
as above specified. When the vertebral or the inferior thyroid branch<br>
arises from the middle of the common carotid, this vessel will have an<br>
additional source of supply if the ligature be applied to it below the<br>
origin of such branch. In the absence of the innominate artery, the<br>
right as well as the left carotid will be found to spring directly from<br>
the aortic arch.<br>
<br>
XIV.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The subclavian arteries.</span>
When a ligature is applied to the inner<br>
third of this vessel within its primary branches, the collateral<br>
circulation is carried on by the anastomoses of the arteries above<br>
mentioned; but if the vertebral or the inferior thyroid arises either<br>
from the aorta or the common carotid, the sources of arterial supply in<br>
respect to the arm will, of course, be less numerous. When the outer<br>
portion of the subclavian is tied between the scalenus and the clavicle,<br>
while the branches arise from its inner part in their usual position and<br>
number, the collateral circulation in reference to the arm is maintained<br>
by the following anastomosing branches:--viz., those of the<br>
superficialis colli, and the supra and posterior scapular, with those of<br>
the acromial thoracic; the subscapular, and the anterior and posterior<br>
circumflex around the shoulder-joint, and over the dorsal surface of<br>
the scapula; and those of the internal mammary and superior intercostal,<br>
with those of the thoracic arteries arising from the axillary. Whatever<br>
be the variety as to their mode or place of origin, the branches<br>
emanating from the subclavian artery are constant as to their<br>
destination. The length of the inner portion of the right subclavian<br>
will vary according to the place at which it arises, whether from the<br>
innominate artery, from the ascending, or from the descending part of<br>
the aortic arch. <br>
<br>
XV.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The axillary artery</span>. As
this vessel gives off<br>
throughout its whole length, numerous branches which inosculate<br>
principally with the scapular, mammary, and superior intercostal<br>
branches of the subclavian, it will be evident that, in tying it above<br>
its own branches, the anastomotic circulation will with much greater<br>
freedom be maintained in respect to the arm, than if the ligature be<br>
applied below those branches. Hence, therefore, when the axillary artery<br>
is affected with aneurism, thereby rendering it unsafe to apply a<br>
ligature to this vessel, it becomes not only pathologically, but<br>
anatomically, the more prudent measure to tie the subclavian immediately<br>
above the clavicle.<br>
<br>
XVI.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The brachial artery</span>,
When this artery is tied immediately below<br>
the axilla, the collateral circulation will be weakly maintained, in<br>
consequence of the small number of anastomosing branches arising from it<br>
above and below the seat of the ligature. The two circumflex humeri<br>
alone send down branches to inosculate with the small muscular offsets<br>
from the middle of the brachial artery. When tied in the middle of the<br>
arm between the origins of the superior and inferior profunda arteries,<br>
the collateral circulation will depend chiefly upon the anastomosis of<br>
the former vessel with the recurrent branch of the radial, and of<br>
muscular branches with each other. When the ligature is applied to the<br>
lower third of the vessel, the collateral circulation will be<br>
comparatively free through the anastomoses of the two profundi and<br>
anastomotic branches with the radial, interosseous, and ulnar recurrent<br>
branches. If the artery happen to divide in the upper part of the arm<br>
into either of the branches of the forearm, or into all three, a<br>
ligature applied to any one of them will, of course, be insufficient to<br>
arrest the direct circulation through the forearm, if this be the object<br>
in view.<br>
<br>
XVII.--The <span style="font-style: italic;">radial artery.</span> If
this vessel be tied in any part of its<br>
course, the collateral circulation will depend principally upon the free<br>
communications between it and the ulnar, through the medium of the<br>
superficial and deep palmar arches and those of the&nbsp; branches
derived<br>
from both vessels, and from the two interossei distributed to the<br>
fingers and back of the hand.<br>
<br>
XVIII.--The <span style="font-style: italic;">ulnar artery.</span>
When this vessel is tied, the collateral<br>
circulation will depend upon the anastomosis of the palmar arches, as in<br>
the case last mentioned. While the radial, ulnar, and interosseous<br>
arteries spring from the same main vessel, and are continuous with each<br>
other in the hand, they represent the condition of a circle of which,<br>
when either side is tied, the blood will pass in a current of almost<br>
equal strength towards the seat of the ligature from above and below--a<br>
circumstance which renders it necessary to tie both ends of the vessel<br>
in cases of wounds.<br>
<br>
XIX.--The <span style="font-style: italic;">common iliac artery</span>.
When a ligature is applied to the middle<br>
of this artery, the direct circulation becomes arrested in the lower<br>
limb and side of the pelvis corresponding to the vessel operated on. The<br>
collateral circulation will then be carried on by the anastomosis of the<br>
following branches--viz., those of the lumbar, the internal mammary, and<br>
the epigastric arteries of that side with each other, and with their<br>
fellows in the anterior abdominal parietes; those of the middle and<br>
lateral sacral; those of the superior with the middle and inferior<br>
haemorrhoidal; those of the aortic and internal iliac uterine branches<br>
in the female; and of the aortic and external iliac spermatic branches<br>
in the male. The anastomoses of these arteries with their opposite<br>
fellows along the median line, are much less frequent than those of the<br>
arteries of the neck and head.<br>
<br>
XX.--<span style="font-style: italic;">The external iliac artery.</span>
This vessel, when tied at its middle,<br>
will have its collateral circulation carried on by the anastomoses of<br>
the internal mammary with the epigastric; by those of the ilio-lumbar<br>
with the circumflex ilii; those of the internal circumflex femoris, and<br>
superior perforating arteries of the profunda femoris, with the<br>
obturator, when this branch arises from the internal iliac; those of the<br>
gluteal with the external circumflex; those of the latter with the<br>
sciatic; and those of both obturators, with each other, when<br>
arising--the one from the internal, the other from the external iliac.<br>
Not unfrequently either the epigastric, obturator, ilio-lumbar, or<br>
circumflex ilii, arises from the middle of the external iliac, in which<br>
case the ligature should be placed above such branch.<br>
<br>
XXI.--The <span style="font-style: italic;">common femoral artery</span>.
On considering the circles of<br>
inosculation formed around the innominate bone between the branches<br>
derived from the iliac arteries near the sacro-iliac junction, and those<br>
emanating from the common femoral, above and below Poupart's ligament,<br>
it will at once appear that, in respect to the lower limb, the<br>
collateral circulation will occur more freely if the ligature be applied<br>
to the main vessel (external iliac) than if to the common femoral below<br>
its branches.<br>
<br>
XXII.--The <span style="font-style: italic;">superficial femoral artery</span>.
When a ligature is applied to<br>
this vessel at the situation where it is overlapped by the sartorius<br>
muscle, the collateral circulation will be maintained by the following<br>
arteries:--the long descending branches of the external circumflex<br>
beneath the rectus muscle, inosculate with the muscular branches of the<br>
anastomotica magna springing from the lower third of the main vessel;<br>
the three perforating branches of the profunda inosculate with the<br>
latter vessel, with the sciatic, and with the articular and muscular<br>
branches around the knee-joint.<br>
<br>
XXIII.--The <span style="font-style: italic;">popliteal artery.</span>
When any circumstance renders it necessary<br>
to tie this vessel in preference to the femoral, the ligature should be<br>
placed above its upper pair of articular branches; for by so doing a<br>
freer collateral circulation will take place in reference to the leg.<br>
The ligature in this situation will lie between the anastomotic and<br>
articular arteries, which freely communicate with each other.<br>
<br>
XXIV.--The <span style="font-style: italic;">anterior and posterior
tibial and peronoeal arteries. </span>As<br>
these vessels correspond to the arteries of the forearm, the<br>
observations which apply to the one set apply also to the other.<br>
