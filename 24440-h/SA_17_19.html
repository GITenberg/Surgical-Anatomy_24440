<big><big>SURGICAL ANATOMY by JOSEPH MACLISE<br>
<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATES 17, 18, &amp; 19.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE WRIST AND HAND.<br>
<br>
A member of such vast importance as the human hand necessarily claims a<br>
high place in regard to surgery. The hand is typical of the mind. It is<br>
the material symbol of the immaterial spirit, It is the prime agent of<br>
the will; and it is that instrument by which the human intellect<br>
manifests its presence in creation. The human hand has a language of its<br>
own. While the tongue demonstrates the thought through the word, the<br>
hand realizes and renders visible the thought through the work. This<br>
organ, therefore, by whose fitness of form the mind declares its own<br>
entity in nature, by the invention and creation of the thing, which is,<br>
as it were, the mind's autograph, claims a high interest in surgical<br>
anatomy; and accordingly the surgeon lays it down as a rule, strictly to<br>
be observed, that when this beautiful and valuable member happens to be<br>
seriously mutilated, in any of those various accidents to which it is<br>
exposed, the prime consideration should be, not as to the fact of how<br>
much of its quantity or parts it can be deprived in operation, but<br>
rather as to how little of its quantity should it be deprived, since no<br>
mechanical ingenuity can fashion an apparatus, capable of supplying the<br>
loss of a finger, or even of one of its joints.<br>
<br>
The main blood vessels and nerves of the arm traverse the front aspect<br>
of the wrist, and are distributed chiefly to supply the palmar surface<br>
of the hand, since in the palm are to be found a greater variety and<br>
number of structures than are met with on the back of the hand. The<br>
radial artery, A, Plate 17, occupies (as its name indicates) the radial<br>
border of the forepart of the wrist, and the ulnar artery, C, Plate 17,<br>
occupies the ulnar border; both vessels in this region of their course<br>
lie parallel to each other; both are comparatively superficial, but of<br>
the two, the radial artery is the more superficial and isolated, and<br>
thereby occasions the radial pulse. The anatomical situation of the<br>
radial artery accounts for the fact, why the pulsation of this vessel is<br>
more easily felt than that of the ulnar artery.<br>
<br>
The radial vessel, A, Plate 17, at the wrist, is not accompanied by the<br>
radial nerve; for this nerve, C, Plate 19, passes from the side of the<br>
artery, at a position, C, Plate 19, varying from one to two or more<br>
inches above the wrist, to gain the dorsal aspect of the hand. The ulnar<br>
artery, C, Plate 17, is attended by the ulnar nerve, D, in the wrist,<br>
and both these pass in company to the palm. The ulnar nerve, D E, lies<br>
on the ulnar border of the artery, and both are in general to be found<br>
ranging along the radial side of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris<br>
muscle, T, and the pisiform bone, G. The situation of the radial artery<br>
is midway between the flexor carpi radialis tendon, I, and the outer<br>
border of the radius. The deep veins, called <span
 style="font-style: italic;">comites</span>, lie in close<br>
connexion with the radial and ulnar arteries. When it is required to lay<br>
bare the radial or ulnar artery, at the wrist, it will be sufficient for<br>
that object to make a simple longitudinal incision (an inch or two in<br>
length) over the course of the vessel A or C, Plate 17, through the<br>
integument, and this incision will expose the fascia, which forms a<br>
common investment for all the structures at this region. When this<br>
fascia has been cautiously slit open on the director, the vessels will<br>
come into view. The ulnar artery, however, lies somewhat concealed<br>
between the adjacent muscles, and in order to bring this vessel fully<br>
into view, it will be necessary to draw aside the tendon of the flexor<br>
ulnaris muscle, T.<br>
<br>
The radial artery, A, Plate 18, passes external to the radial border of<br>
the wrist, beneath the extensor tendons, B, of the thumb; and after<br>
winding round the head of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, as seen at<br>
E, Plate 19, forms the deep palmar arch E, Plate 18. This deep palmar<br>
arch lies close upon the forepart of the carpo-metacarpal joints; it<br>
sends off branches to supply the deeply situated muscles, and other<br>
structures of the palm; and from it are also derived other branches,<br>
which pierce the interosseal spaces, and appear on the back of the hand,<br>
Plate 19. The deep palmar arch, E, Plate 18, inosculates with a branch<br>
of the ulnar artery, I, Plate 18, whilst its dorsal interosseal<br>
branches, Plate 19, communicate freely with the dorsal carpal arch,<br>
which is formed by a branch of the radial artery E, Plate 19, and the<br>
terminal branch of the posterior interosseous vessel.<br>
<br>
The ulnar artery, C, Plate 17, holds a direct and superficial course,<br>
from the ulnar border of the forearm through the wrist; and still<br>
remains superficial in the palm, where it forms the superficial palmar<br>
arch, F. From this arch arise three or four branches of considerable<br>
size, which are destined to supply the fingers. A little above the<br>
interdigital clefts, each of these digital arteries divides into two<br>
branches, which pass along the adjacent sides of two fingers--a mode of<br>
distribution which also characterises the digital branches of the<br>
median, <span style="font-style: italic;">b b</span>, and ulnar
nerves, <span style="font-style: italic;">e e</span>. The superficial
palmar arch of the<br>
ulnar vessel anastomoses with the deep arch of the radial vessel. The<br>
principal points of communication are, first, by the branch, (ramus<br>
profundus,) I, Plate 18, which passes between the muscles of the little<br>
finger to join the deep arch beneath the long flexor tendons. 2nd, by<br>
the branch (superficialis volae) which springs from the radial artery,<br>
A, Plate 17, and crosses the muscles of the ball of the thumb, to join<br>
the terminal branch of the superficial arch, F, Plate 17. 3rd, by<br>
another terminal branch of the superficial arch, which joins the<br>
arteries of the thumb, derived from the radial vessel, as seen at <span
 style="font-style: italic;">e</span>,<br>
Plate 18.<br>
<br>
The frequent anastomosis thus seen to take place between the branches of<br>
the radial, the ulnar, and the interosseous arteries in the hand, should<br>
be carefully borne in mind by the surgeon. The continuity of the three<br>
vessels by anastomosis, renders it very difficult to arrest a<br>
haemorrhage occasioned by a wound of either of them. It will be at once<br>
seen, that when a haemorrhage takes place from any of these larger<br>
vessels of the hand, the bleeding will not be commanded by the<br>
application of a ligature to either the radial, the ulnar, or the<br>
interosseous arteries in the forearm; and for this plain reason, viz.,<br>
that though in the arm these arteries are separate, in the hand their<br>
communication renders them as one.<br>
<br>
If a haemorrhage therefore take place from either of the palmar vessels,<br>
it will not be sufficient to place a ligature around the radial or the<br>
ulnar artery singly, for if F, Plate 17, bleeds, and in order to arrest<br>
that bleeding we tie the vessel C, Plate 17, still the vessel F will<br>
continue to bleed, in consequence of its communication with the vessel<br>
E, Plate 18, by the branch 1, Plate 18, and other branches above<br>
mentioned. If E, Plate 18, bleeds, a ligature applied to the vessel A,<br>
Plate 18, will not stop the flow of blood, because of the fact that E<br>
anastomoses with G, by the branch I and other branches, as seen in<br>
Plates 17 and 19.<br>
<br>
Any considerable haemorrhage, therefore, which may be caused by a wound<br>
of the superficial or deep palmar arches, or their branches, and which<br>
we are unable to arrest by compression, applied directly to the patent<br>
orifices of the vessel, will in general require that a ligature be<br>
applied to both the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist; and it<br>
occasionally happens that even this proceeding will not stop the flow of<br>
blood, for the interosseous arteries, which also communicate with the<br>
vessels of the hand, may still maintain the current of circulation<br>
through them. These interosseous arteries being branches of the ulnar<br>
artery, and being given off from the vessel at the bend of the elbow, if<br>
the bleeding be still kept up from the vessel wounded in the hand, after<br>
the ligature of the ulnar and radial arteries is accomplished, are in<br>
all probability the channels of communication, and in this case the<br>
brachial artery must be tied. A consideration of the above mentioned<br>
facts, proper to the normal distribution of the vessels of the upper<br>
extremity, will explain to the practitioner the cause of the difficulty<br>
which occasionally presents itself, as to the arrest of haemorrhage from<br>
the vessels of the hand. In addition to these facts he will do well to<br>
remember some other arrangements of these vessels, which are liable to<br>
occur; and upon these I shall offer a few observations.<br>
<br>
While I view the normal disposition of the arteries of the arm as a<br>
whole, (and this view of the whole great fact is no doubt necessary, if<br>
we would take within the span and compass of the reason, all the lesser<br>
facts of which the whole is inclusive,) I find that as one main vessel<br>
(the brachial) divides into three lesser branches, (the ulnar, radial<br>
and interosseous,) so, therefore, when either of these three supplies<br>
the haemorrhage, and any difficulty arises preventing our having access<br>
at once to the open orifices of the wounded vessel, we can command the<br>
flow of blood by applying a ligature to the main trunk--the brachial. If<br>
this measure fail to command the bleeding, then we may conclude that the<br>
wounded vessel (whichever it happen to be, whether the radial, the<br>
ulnar, or the interosseous) arises from the brachial artery, higher up<br>
in the arm than that place whereat we applied the ligature. To this<br>
variety as to the place of origin, the ulnar, radial, and interosseous<br>
arteries are individually liable.<br>
<br>
Again, as the single brachial artery divides into the three arteries of<br>
the forearm, and as these latter again unite into what may (practically<br>
speaking) be termed a single vessel in the hand, in consequence of their<br>
anastomosis, so it is obvious that in order to command a bleeding from<br>
any of the palmar arteries, we should apply a ligature upon each of the<br>
vessels of the forearm, or upon the single main vessel in the arm. When<br>
the former proceeding fails, we have recourse to the latter, and when<br>
this latter fails (for fail it will, sometimes,) we then reasonably<br>
arrive at the conclusion that some one of the three vessels of the<br>
forearm, springs higher up than the place of the ligature on the main<br>
brachial vessel.<br>
<br>
But however varied as to the normal locality of their origin, at the<br>
bend of the elbow, these vessels of the forearm may at times manifest<br>
themselves, still one point is quite fixed and certain, viz., that they<br>
communicate with each other in the hand. Hence, therefore, it becomes<br>
evident, that in order to command, at once and effectually, a bleeding,<br>
either from the palmar arteries, or those of the forearm, we attain to a<br>
more sure and successful result, the nearer we approach the<br>
fountain-head and place a ligature on it--the brachial artery. It is<br>
true that to stop the circulation through the main vessel of the limb,<br>
is always attended with danger, and that such a proceeding is never to<br>
be adopted but as the lesser one of two great hazards. It is also true<br>
that to tie the main brachial artery for a haemorrhage of anyone of its<br>
terminal branches, may be doing too much, while a milder course may<br>
serve; or else that even our tying the brachial may not suffice, owing<br>
to a high distribution of the vessels of the arm, in the axilla, above<br>
the place of the ligature. Thus doubt as to the safest measure, viz.,<br>
that which is sufficient and no more, enveils the proper place whereat<br>
to apply a ligature on the principal vessel; but whatever be the doubt<br>
as to this particular, there can be none attending the following rule of<br>
conduct, viz., that in all cases of haemorrhage, caused by wounds of the<br>
vessels of the upper limb, we should, if at all practicable, endeavour<br>
to stop the flow of blood from the divided vessels <span
 style="font-style: italic;">in the wound itself,</span><br>
by ligature or otherwise; and both ends of the divided vessel require to<br>
be tied. Whenever this may be done, we need not trouble ourselves<br>
concerning the anomaly in vascular distribution.<br>
<br>
The superficial palmar arch, F, Plate 17, lies beneath the dense palmar<br>
fascia; and whenever matter happens to be pent up by this fascia, and it<br>
is necessary that an opening be made for its exit, the incision should<br>
be conducted at a distance from the locality of the vessel. When matter<br>
forms beneath the palmar fascia, it is liable, owing to the unyielding<br>
nature of this fibrous structure, to burrow upwards into the forearm,<br>
beneath the annular ligament D, Plates 17 and 18. All deep incisions<br>
made in the median line of the forepart of the wrist are liable to wound<br>
the median nerve B, Plate 17. When the thumb, together with its<br>
metacarpal bone, is being amputated, the radial artery E, Plate 19,<br>
which winds round near the head of that bone, may be wounded. It is<br>
possible, by careful dissection, to perform this operation without<br>
dividing the radial vessel.<br>
