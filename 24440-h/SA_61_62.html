COMMENTARY ON PLATES 61 &amp; 62.<br>
<br>
DEFORMITIES OF THE PROSTATE.--DISTORTIONS AND<br>
OBSTRUCTIONS OF THE PROSTATIC URETHRA.<br>
<br>
The prostate is liable to such frequent and varied deformities, the<br>
consequence of diseased action, whilst, at the same time, its healthy<br>
function (if it have any) in the male body is unknown, that it admits at<br>
least of one interpretation which may, according to fact, be given of<br>
it--namely, that of playing a principal part in effecting some of the<br>
most distressing of "the thousand natural ills that flesh is heir to."<br>
But heedless of such a singular explanation of a final cause, the<br>
practical surgeon will readily confess the fitting application of the<br>
interpretation, such as it is, and rest contented with the proximate<br>
facts and proofs. As physiologists, however, it behooves us to look<br>
further into nature, and search for the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ultimate fact</span> in her prime<br>
moving law. The prostate is peculiar to the male body, the uterus to the<br>
female. With the exception of these two organs there is not another<br>
which appears in the one sex but has its analogue in the opposite sex;<br>
and thus these two organs, the prostate and the uterus, appear by<br>
exclusion of the rest to approach the test of comparison, by which their<br>
analogy becomes as fully manifested as that between the two quantities,<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">a-b</span>, and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a+b</span> the only difference which
exists depends upon the<br>
subtraction or the addition of the quantity, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>. The difference between a<br>
prostate and a uterus is simply one of quantity, such as we see existing<br>
between the male and the female breast. The prostate is to the uterus<br>
absolutely what a rudimentary organ is to its fully developed analogue.<br>
The one, as being superfluous, is in accordance with nature's law of<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">nihil supervacaneum nihil frutra</span>,
arrested in its development, and in<br>
such a character appears the prostate. This body <span
 style="font-style: italic;">is not a gland</span> any more<br>
than is the uterus, but both organs being quantitatively, and hence<br>
functionally different, I here once more venture to call down an<br>
interpretation of the part from the unfrequented bourne of comparative<br>
anatomy, and turning it to lend an interest to the accompanying figures<br>
even with a surgical bearing, I remark that the prostatic or rudimentary<br>
uterus, like a germ not wholly blighted, is prone to an occasional<br>
sprouting or increase beyond its prescribed dimensions--a hypertrophy in<br>
barren imitation, as it were, of gestation. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
<br>
[Footnote: This expression of the fact to which I allude will not, I<br>
trust, be extended beyond the limits I assign to it. Though I have every<br>
reason to believe, that between the prostate of the male and the uterus<br>
of the female, the same amount of analogy exists, as between a coccygeal<br>
ossicle and the complete vertebral form elsewhere situated in the spinal<br>
series, I am as far from regarding the two former to be in all respects<br>
structurally or functionally alike, as I am from entertaining the like<br>
idea in respect to the two latter. But still I maintain that between a<br>
prostate and a uterus, as between a coccygeal bone and a vertebra, the<br>
only difference which exists is one of quantity, and that hence arises<br>
the functional difference. A prostate is part of a uterus, just as a<br>
coccygeal bone is part (the centrum) of a vertebra. That this is the<br>
absolute signification of the prostate I firmly believe, and were this<br>
the proper place, I could prove it in detail, by the infallible rule of<br>
analogical reasoning. John Hunter has observed that the use of the<br>
prostate was not sufficiently known to enable us to form a judgment of<br>
the bad consequences of its diseased state. When the part becomes<br>
morbidly enlarged, it acts as a mechanical impediment to the passage of<br>
urine from the bladder, but from this circumstance we cannot reasonably<br>
infer, that while of its normal healthy proportions, its special<br>
function is to facilitate the egress of the urine, for the female<br>
bladder, though wholly devoid of the prostate, performs its own function<br>
perfectly. It appears to me, therefore, that the real question should<br>
be, not what is the use of the prostate? but has it any proper function?<br>
If the former question puzzled even the philosophy of Hunter, it was<br>
because the latter question must be answered in the negative. The<br>
prostate has no function proper to itself <span
 style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>. It is a thing distinct<br>
from the urinary apparatus, and distinct likewise from the generative<br>
organs. It may be hypertrophied or atrophied, or changed in texture, or<br>
wholly destroyed by abscess, and yet neither of the functions of these<br>
two systems of organs will be impaired, if the part while diseased act<br>
not as an obstruction to them. In texture the prostate is similar to an<br>
unimpregnated uterus. In form it is, like the uterus, symmetrical. In<br>
position it corresponds to the uterus. The prostate has no ducts proper<br>
to itself. Those ducts which are said to belong to it (prostatic ducts)<br>
are merely mucous cells, similar to those in other parts of the urethral<br>
lining membrane. The seminal ducts evidently do not belong to it. The<br>
texture of the prostate is not such as appears in glandular bodies<br>
generally. In short, the facts which prove what it is not, prove what it<br>
actually is--namely, a uterus arrested in its development, and as a sign<br>
of that all-encompassing law in nature, which science expresses by the<br>
term "unity in variety." This interpretation of the prostate, which I<br>
believe to be true to nature, will last perhaps till such time as the<br>
microscopists shall discover in its "<span style="font-style: italic;">secretion</span>"
some species of<br>
mannikins, such as may pair with those which they term spermatozoa.]<br>

Fig. 1, Plate 61.--The prostate,<span style="font-style: italic;"> a b</span>,
is here represented thinned in its<br>
walls above and below. The lower wall is dilated into a pouch caused by<br>
the points of misdirected instruments in catheterism having been rashly<br>
forced against it.<br>

<br>
<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 61.--The prostate, <span style="font-style: italic;">a b,</span>
is here seen to be somewhat more<br>
enlarged than is natural. A tubercle, <span style="font-weight: bold;">b</span>,
surmounts the lower part, <span style="font-style: italic;">c,</span>
of<br>
the prostate, and blocks up the vesical orifice. Catheters introduced by<br>
the urethra for retention of urine which existed in this case, have had<br>
their points arrested at the bulb, and on being pushed forwards in this<br>
direction, have dilated the bulb into the form of a pouch, seen at <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d.</span><br>
The sinus of the bulb, being the lowest part of the urethral canal, is<br>
very liable to be distorted or perforated by the points of instruments<br>
descending upon it from above and before. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: When a stricture exists immediately behind the bulb, this<br>
circumstance will, of course, favour the occurrence of the accident.<br>
"False passages (observes Mr. Benjamin Phillips) are less frequent here<br>
(in the membranous part of the urethra) than in the bulbous portion of<br>
the canal. The reason of this must be immediately evident: false<br>
passages are ordinarily made in consequence of the difficulty<br>
experienced in the endeavour to pass an instrument through the<br>
strictured portion of the tube. Stricture is most frequently seated at<br>
the point of junction between the bulbous and membranous portions of the<br>
canal; consequently, the false passage will be usually anterior to this<br>
latter point."--(On the Urethra, its Diseases. &amp;c., p. 15.) ]<br>

corresponding to the shape of the obstructing body. The prostate, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b b,</span><br>
is enlarged in both its lateral lobes. A small bougie, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c,</span> is placed in<br>
the prostatic canal and vesical opening.<br>

Fig. 5, Plate 61.--The prostate, <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>,
is considerably enlarged, and the<br>
vesical orifice is girt by a prominent ring, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b b</span>, from the right border<br>
of which the nipple-shaped body, <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,
projects and occupies the outlet.<br>
Owing to the retention of urine caused by this state of the prostate,<br>
the ureters, <span style="font-style: italic;">c c</span>, have become
very much dilated.<br>

<br>
Fig. 6, Plate 61.--The lateral lobes of the prostate, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c c,</span> are seen<br>
enlarged, and from the inner side and base of each, irregularly shaped<br>
masses, <span style="font-style: italic;">a, b, d,</span> project, and
bend the prostatic urethra first to the<br>
right side, then to the left. The part, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a,</span> resting upon the part, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>,<br>
acts like a valve against the vesical outlet, which would become closed<br>
the tighter according to the degree of superincumbent pressure. A<br>
flexible catheter would, in such a case as this, be more likely,<br>
perhaps, to follow the sinuous course of the prostatic passage than a<br>
rigid instrument of metal.<br>

irregularly enlarged, and the urinary passage is bent towards the right<br>
side, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, from the membranous
portion, which is central. Surmounting the<br>
vesical orifice, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, is seen
the tuberculated mass, <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,
which being<br>
moveable, can be forced against the vesical orifice and thus produce<br>
complete retention of urine. In this case, also, a flexible catheter<br>
would be more suitable than a metallic one.<br>

The third lobe, <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, projects
at the neck of the bladder, distorting the<br>
vesical outlet. A small calculus occupies the prostatic urethra, and<br>
being closely impacted in this part of the canal, would arrest the<br>
progress of a catheter, and probably lead to the supposition that the<br>
instrument grated against a stone in the interior of the bladder, in<br>
which case it would be inferred that since the urine did not flow<br>
through the catheter no retention existed.<br>

</big></big><big><big>Fig. 10, Plate 61.--Both lateral lobes, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b c,</span> of
the prostate appear much<br>
increased in size. A large irregular shaped mass, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a,</span> grows from the base<br>
of the right lobe, and distorts the prostatic canal and vesical orifice.<br>
When the lobes of the prostate increase in size in this direction, the<br>
prostatic canal becomes much more elongated than natural, and hence the<br>
instrument which is to be passed for relieving the existing retention of<br>
urine should have a wide and long curve to correspond with the form of<br>
this part of the urethra. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Both lobes of the prostate are equally liable to chronic<br>
enlargement. Home believed the left lobe to be oftener increased in size<br>
than the right. Wilson (on the Male Urinary and Genital Organs) mentions<br>
several instances of the enlargement of the right lobe. No reason can be<br>
assigned why one lobe should be more prone to hypertrophy than the<br>
other, even supposing it to be matter of fact, which it is not. But the<br>
observations made by Cruveilhier (Anat. Pathol.), that the lobulated<br>
projections of the prostate always take place internally at its vesical<br>
aspect, is as true as the manner in which he accounts for the fact is<br>
plausible. The dense fibrous envelope of the prostate is sufficient to<br>
repress its irregular growth externally.]<br>
<br>

Fig. 11, Plate 61.--Both lobes of the prostate are enlarged, and from<br>
the base of each a mass projects prominently around the vesical orifice,<br>

been moulded to the shape of the<br>
instrument, which was retained in it for a considerable time.<br>

Fig. 12, Plate 61.--The prostate, <span style="font-style: italic;">c b</span>,
is enlarged and dilated, like a<br>
sac. Across the neck, <span style="font-style: italic;">a,</span> of
the bladder the prostate projects in an<br>
arched form, and is transfixed by the instrument, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>. The prostate may<br>
assume this appearance, as well from instruments having been forced<br>
against it, as from an abscess cavity formed in its substance having<br>
received, from time to time, a certain amount of the urine, and retained<br>
this fluid under the pressure of strong efforts, made to void the<br>
bladder while the vesical orifice was closed above.<br>

Fig. 13, Plate 61.--The lateral lobes, <span

enlarged; and, occupying the position of the third lobe, appear as three<br>
masses, <span style="font-style: italic;">a b c,</span> plicated upon
each other, and directed towards the<br>
vesical orifice, which they close like valves. The prostatic urethra<br>
branches upwards into three canals, formed by the relative position of<br>
the parts, <span style="font-style: italic;">e, c, b, a, d,</span> at
the neck of the bladder. The ureters are<br>
dilated, in consequence of the regurgitation of the contents of the<br>
bladder during the retention which existed ..<br>

<br>
Fig. 1, Plate 62, exhibits the lobes of the prostate greatly increased<br>
in size. The part, <span style="font-style: italic;">a b,</span> girds
irregularly, and obstructs the vesical<br>
outlet, while the lateral lobes, <span style="font-style: italic;">c d,</span>
encroach upon the space of the<br>
prostatic canal. The walls of the bladder are much thickened.<br>

enlarged and of equal size, moulded against each other in such a way<br>
that the prostatic canal and vesical orifice appear as mere clefts<br>
between them. The three lobes are encrusted on their vesical surfaces<br>
with a thick calcareous deposit. The surface of the third lobe, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a,</span> which<br>
has been half denuded of the calcareous crust, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, in order to show its<br>
real character, appeared at first to be a stone impacted in the neck of<br>
the bladder, and of such a nature it certainly would seem to the touch,<br>
on striking it with the point of a sound or other instrument.<br>

its three lobes enlarged,<br>
and the prostatic canal and vesical orifice narrowed. The walls of the<br>
bladder are thickened, fasciculated, and sacculated; the two former<br>
appearances being caused by a hypertrophy of the vesical fibres, while<br>
the latter is in general owing to a protrusion of the mucous membrane<br>
between the fasciculi.<br>

being of large size, and projecting far into the interior of the<br>
bladder, from around the vesical orifice which they obstruct. The<br>
bladder is thickened, and the prostatic canal is elongated. The urethra<br>
and the lobes of the prostate have been perforated by instruments,<br>
passed for the retention of urine which existed. A stricturing band, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">e,</span><br>
is seen to cross the membranous part of the canal.<br>

Fig. 5, Plate 62.--The prostate, <span style="font-style: italic;">a a,</span>

thickened. The ureters, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>,
are dilated, and perforations made by<br>
instruments are seen in the prostate. The prostatic canal being directed<br>
almost vertically, and the neck of the bladder being raised nearly as<br>
high as the upper border of the pubic symphysis, it must appear that if<br>
a stone rest in the bas fond of the bladder, a sound or staff cannot<br>
reach the stone, unless by perforating the prostate; and if, while the<br>
staff occupies this position, lithotomy be performed, the incisions will<br>
not be required to be made of a greater depth than if the prostate were<br>
of its ordinary proportions. On the contrary, if the staff happen to<br>
have surmounted the prostate, the incision, in order to divide the whole<br>
vertical thickness of this body, will require to be made very deeply<br>
from the perinaeal surface, and this circumstance occasions what is<br>
termed a "deep perinaeum."<br>

</big></big><big><big><br>
Fig. 6, Plate 62.--The lower half, <span style="font-style: italic;">c,
b, f,</span> of the prostate, having<br>
become the seat of abscess, appears hollowed out in the form of a sac.<br>
This sac is separated from the bladder by a horizontal septum, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">e e,</span> the<br>
proper base of the bladder, <span style="font-style: italic;">g g</span>.
The prostatic urethra, between <span style="font-style: italic;">a e</span>,
has<br>
become vertical in respect to the membranous part of the canal, in<br>
consequence of the upward pressure of the abscess. The sac opens into<br>
the urethra, near the apex of the prostate, at the point <span
 style="font-style: italic;">c</span>; and a<br>
catheter passed along the urethra has entered the orifice of the sac,<br>
the interior of which the instrument traverses, and the posterior wall<br>
of which it perforates. The bladder contains a large calculus, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">i</span>. The<br>
bladder and sac do not communicate, but the urethra is a canal common to<br>
both. In a case of this sort it becomes evident that, although symptoms<br>
may strongly indicate either a retention of urine, or the presence of a<br>
stone in the bladder, any instrument taking the position and direction<br>
of <span style="font-style: italic;">d d,</span> cannot relieve the
one or detect the other; and such is the<br>
direction in which the instrument must of necessity pass, while the sac<br>
presents its orifice more in a line with the membranous part of the<br>
urethra than the neck of the bladder is. The sac will intervene between<br>
the rectum and the bladder; and on examination of the parts through the<br>
bowel, an instrument in the sac will readily be mistaken for being in<br>
the bladder, while neither a calculus in the bladder, nor this organ in<br>
a state of even extreme distention, can be detected by the touch any<br>
more than by the sound or catheter. If, while performing lithotomy in<br>
such a state of the parts, the staff occupy the situation of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d d d</span>, then<br>
the knife, following the staff, will open, not the bladder which<br>
contains the stone, but the sac, which, moreover, if it happen to be<br>
filled with urine regurgigated from the urethra, will render the<br>
deception more complete.<br>

Fig. 7, Plate 62.--The walls, <span style="font-style: italic;">a a</span>,
of the bladder, appear greatly<br>
thickened, and the ureters, <span style="font-style: italic;">b,</span>
dilated. The sides, <span style="font-style: italic;">c c c,</span> of
the<br>
prostate are thinned; and in the prostatic canal are two calculi, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d d,</span><br>
closely impacted. In such a state of the parts it would be impossible to<br>
pass a catheter into the bladder for the relief of a retention of urine,<br>
or to introduce a staff as a guide to the knife in lithotomy. If,<br>
however, the staff can be passed as far as the situation of the stone,<br>
the parts may be held with a sufficient degree of steadiness to enable<br>
the operator to incise the prostate upon the stone.<br>
