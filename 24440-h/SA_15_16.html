<big><big>SURGICAL ANATOMY by JOSEPH MACLISE<br>
<br>
<br>
COMMENTARY ON PLATES 15 &amp; 16.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE BEND OF THE ELBOW<br>
AND THE FOREARM, SHOWING THE RELATIVE POSITION<br>
OF THE ARTERIES, VEINS, NERVES, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The farther the surgical region happens to be removed from the centre of<br>
the body, the less likely is it that all accidents or operations which<br>
involve such regions will concern the life immediately. The limbs<br>
undergo all kinds of mutilation, both by accident and intention, and yet<br>
the patient survives; but when the like happens at any region of the<br>
trunk of the body, the life will be directly and seriously threatened.<br>
It seems, therefore, that in the same degree as the living principle<br>
diverges from the body's centre into the outstanding members, in that<br>
degree is the life weakened in intensity; and just as, according to<br>
physical laws, the ray of light becomes less and less intense by the<br>
square of the distance from the central source, so the vital ray, or<br>
vis, loses momentum in the same ratio as it diverges from the common<br>
central line to the periphery.<br>
<br>
The relative anatomy of every surgical region becomes a study of more or<br>
less interest to the surgeon, according to the degree of importance<br>
attaching to the organs contained, or according to the frequency of such<br>
accidents as are liable to occur in each. The bend of the elbow is a<br>
region of anatomical importance, owing to the fact of its giving passage<br>
to C, Plate 15, the main artery of the limb, and also because in it are<br>
located the veins D, B, E, F, which are frequently the subject of<br>
operation. The anatomy of this region becomes, therefore, important;<br>
forasmuch as the operation which is intended to concern the veins alone,<br>
may also, by accident, include the main arterial vessel which they<br>
overlie. The nerves, which are seen to accompany the veins<br>
superficially, as well as that which accompanies the more<br>
deeply-situated artery, are, for the same reason, required to be known.<br>
<br>
The course of the brachial artery along the inner border of the biceps<br>
muscle is comparatively superficial, from the point where it leaves the<br>
axilla to the bend of the elbow. In the whole of this course it is<br>
covered by the fascia of the arm, which serves to isolate it from the<br>
superficial basilic vein, B, and the internal cutaneous nerve, both of<br>
which nevertheless overlie the artery. The median nerve, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, Plate 15,<br>
accompanies the artery in its proper sheath, which is a duplication of<br>
the common fascia; and in this sheath are also situated the venae<br>
comites, making frequent loops around the artery. The median nerve<br>
itself, D, Plate 16, takes a direct course down the arm; and the<br>
different relative positions which this nerve holds in reference to the<br>
artery, C, at the upper end, the middle, and the lower end of the arm,<br>
occur mainly in consequence of the undulating character of the vessel<br>
itself.<br>
<br>
When it is required to ligature the artery in the middle of the arm, the<br>
median nerve will be found, in general, at its outer side, between it<br>
and the biceps; but as the course of the artery is from the inner side<br>
of the biceps to the middle of the bend of the elbow, so we find it<br>
passing under the nerve to gain this locality, C, Plate 16, where the<br>
median nerve, D, then becomes situated at the inner side of the vessel.<br>
The median nerve, thus found to be differently situated in reference to<br>
the brachial artery, at the upper, the middle, and the lower part of the<br>
arm, is (with these facts always held in memory) taken as the guide to<br>
that vessel. An incision made of sufficient length (an inch and a half,<br>
more or less) over the course of the artery, and to the outer side of<br>
the basilic vein, B, Plate 16, will divide the skin, subcutaneous<br>
adipose membrane, which varies much in thickness in several individuals,<br>
and will next expose the common fascial envelope of the arm. When this<br>
fascia is opened, by dividing it on the director, the artery becomes<br>
exposed; the median nerve is then to be separated from the side of the<br>
vessel by the probe or director, and, with the precaution of not<br>
including the venal comites, the ligature may now be passed around the<br>
vessel. In the lower third of the arm it is not likely that the operator<br>
will encounter the ulnar nerve, and mistake it for the median, since the<br>
former, <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, Plate 16, is
considerably removed from the vessel. If the<br>
incision be made precisely in the usual course of the brachial artery,<br>
the ulnar nerve will not show itself. It will be well, however, to bear<br>
in mind the possible occurrence of some of those anomalies to that<br>
normal relative position of the artery, the median, and the ulnar nerve,<br>
which the accompanying Plates represent.<br>
<br>
The median nerve, D, Plate 16, is sometimes found to lie beneath the<br>
artery in the middle and lower third of the arm. At other times it is<br>
found far removed to the inner side of the usual position of the vessel,<br>
and lying in close contact with the ulnar nerve, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>. Or the brachial<br>
artery may take this latter position, while the median nerve stands<br>
alone at the position of D, Plate 16. Or both the main artery and the<br>
median nerve may course much to the inner side of the biceps muscle, A,<br>
Plate 16, while in the usual situation of the nerve and vessel there is<br>
only to be found a small arterial branch (the radial), which springs<br>
from the brachial, high up in the arm. Or the nerve and vessel may be<br>
lying concealed beneath a slip of the brachialis anticus muscle, E,<br>
Plate 16, in which case no appearance of them will be at all manifested<br>
through the usual place of incision made for the ligature of the<br>
brachial vessel. Or, lastly, there may be found more arteries than the<br>
single main brachial appearing at this place in the arm, and such<br>
condition of a plurality of vessels occurs in consequence of a high<br>
division of the brachial artery. Each of these variations from the<br>
normal type is more or less frequent; and though it certainly is of<br>
practical import to bear them in mind, still, as we never can foretell<br>
their occurrence by a superficial examination of the limb, or pronounce<br>
them to be present till we actually encounter them in operation, it is<br>
only when we find them that we commence to reason upon the facts; but<br>
even at this crisis the knowledge of their anatomy may prevent a<br>
confusion of ideas.<br>
<br>
That generalization of the facts of such anomalies as are liable to<br>
occur to the normal character of the brachial artery, represented in<br>
Plates 15 and 16, which appears to me as being most inclusive of all<br>
their various conditions, is this--viz., that the point of division into<br>
radial, ulnar, and interosseous, which F, Plate 16, usually marks, may<br>
take place at any part of the member between the bend of the elbow and<br>
the coracoid process in the axillary space.<br>
<br>
At the bend of the elbow, the brachial artery usually occupies the<br>
middle point between <span style="font-style: italic;">e,</span> the
inner condyle of the humerus and the<br>
external margin of the supinator radii longus muscle, G. The structures<br>
which overlie the arterial vessel, C, Plate 16, at this locality,<br>
numbering them from its own depth to the cutaneous surface, are these--<br>
viz., some adipose cellular membrane envelopes the vessel, as it lies on<br>
E, the brachialis anticus muscle, and between the two accompanying<br>
veins; at the inner side of the artery, but separated from it by a small<br>
interval occupied by one of the veins, is situated the median nerve <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d</span>,<br>
Plate 15. Above all three structures is stretched that dense fibrous<br>
band of the fascia, H, Plate 16, which becomes incorporated with the<br>
common fascial covering of the forearm. Over this fascial process lies<br>
the median basilic vein, F B, Plate 15, accompanying which are seen some<br>
branches of the internal cutaneous nerve. The subcutaneous adipose<br>
tissue and common integument cover these latter. If it be required to<br>
ligature the artery at this locality, an incision two inches and a half<br>
in length, made along the course of the vessel, and avoiding the<br>
superficial veins, will expose the fascia; and this being next divided<br>
on the director, the artery will be exposed resting on the brachialis<br>
anticus, and between the biceps tendon and pronator teres muscle. As<br>
this latter muscle differs in width in several individuals, sometimes<br>
lying in close contact with the artery, and at other times leaving a<br>
considerable interval between the vessel and itself, its outer margin is<br>
not, therefore, to be taken as a sure guide to the artery. The inner<br>
border of the biceps indicates much more generally the situation of the<br>
vessel.<br>
<br>
The bend of the elbow being that locality where the operation of<br>
phlebotomy is generally performed, it is therefore required to take<br>
exact account of the structures which occupy this region, and more<br>
especially the relation which the superficial veins hold to the deeper<br>
seated artery. In Plate 15, the artery, C, is shown in its situation<br>
beneath the fascial aponeurosis, which comes off from the tendon of the<br>
biceps, a portion of which has been cut away; and the venous vessel, F<br>
B, which usually occupies the track of the artery, is pushed a little to<br>
the inner side. While opening any part of the vessel, F B, which<br>
overlies the artery, it is necessary to proceed with caution, as well<br>
because of the fact that between the artery, C, and the vein, F B, the<br>
fascia alone intervenes, as also because the ulnar artery is given off<br>
rather frequently from the main vessel at this situation, and passes<br>
superficial to the fascia and flexors of the forearm, to gain its usual<br>
position at K, Plate 15. I have met with a well marked example of this<br>
occurrence in the living subject.<br>
<br>
The cephalic vein, D, is accompanied by the external cutaneous nerve,<br>
which branches over the fascia on the outer border of the forearm. The<br>
basilic vein, B, is accompanied by the internal cutaneous nerve, which<br>
branches in a similar way over the fascia of the inner and fore part of<br>
the forearm. The numerous branches of both these nerves interlace with<br>
the superficial veins, and are liable to be cut when these veins are<br>
being punctured. Though the median basilic, F, and the basilic vein, B,<br>
are those generally chosen in the performance of the operation of<br>
bleeding, it will be seen, in Plate 15, that their contiguity to the<br>
artery necessarily demands more care and precision in that operation<br>
executed upon them, than if D, the cephalic vein, far removed as it is<br>
from the course of the artery, were the seat of phlebotomy.<br>
<br>
As it is required, in order to distend the superficial veins, D, B, F,<br>
that a band should be passed around the limb at some locality between<br>
them and the heart, so that they may yield a free flow of blood on<br>
puncture, a moderate pressure will be all that is needful for that end.<br>
It is a fact worthy of notice, that the excessive pressure of the<br>
ligaturing band around the limb at A B, Plate 15, will produce the same<br>
effect upon the veins near F, as if the pressure were defective, for in<br>
the former case the ligature will obstruct the flow of blood through the<br>
artery; and the vein, F, will hence be undistended by the recurrent<br>
blood, just as when, in the latter case, the ligature, making too feeble<br>
a pressure on the vein, B, will not obstruct its current in that degree<br>
necessary to distend the vessel, F.<br>
<br>
Whichever be the vein chosen for phlebotomy at the bend of the elbow, it<br>
will be seen, from an examination of Plates 15 and 16, that the opening<br>
may be made with most advantage according to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the vessel; for the vessel while being cut open in this direction, is<br>
less likely to swerve from the point of the lancet than if it were to be<br>
incised across, which latter mode is also far more liable to implicate<br>
the artery. Besides, as the nerves course along the veins from above<br>
downwards--making, with each other, and with the vessels, but very acute<br>
angles--all incisions made longitudinally in these vessels, will not be<br>
so likely to divide any of these nerves as when the instrument is<br>
directed to cut crossways.<br>
<br>
The brachial artery usually divides, at the bend of the elbow, into the<br>
radial, the ulnar, and the interosseous branches. The point F, Plate 16,<br>
is the common place of division, and this will be seen in the Plate to<br>
be somewhat below the level of the inner condyle, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">e.</span> From that place,<br>
where the radial and ulnar arteries spring, these vessels traverse the<br>
forearm, in general under cover of the muscles and fascia, but<br>
occasionally superficial to both these structures. The radial artery, F<br>
N, Plate 16, takes a comparatively superficial course along the radial<br>
border of the forearm, and is accompanied, for the upper two-thirds of<br>
its length, by the radial branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, seen in<br>
Plate 16, at the outer side of the vessel. The supinator radii longus<br>
muscle in general overlaps, with its inner border, both the radial<br>
artery and nerve. At the situation of the radial pulse, I, Plate 15, the<br>
artery is not accompanied by the nerve, for this latter will be seen, in<br>
plate 16, to pass outward, under the tendon of the supinator muscle, to<br>
the integuments.<br>
<br>
The ulnar artery, whose origin is seen near F, Plate 16, passes deeply<br>
beneath the superficial flexor muscles, L M K, and the pronator teres,<br>
I, and first emerges from under cover of these at the point O, from<br>
which point to S, Plate 16, the artery may be felt, in the living body,<br>
obscurely beating as the ulnar pulse. On the inner border of the ulnar<br>
artery, and in close connexion with it, the ulnar nerve may be seen<br>
looped round by small branches of the vessel.<br>
<br>
The radial and ulnar arteries may be exposed and ligatured in any part<br>
of their course; but of the two, the radial vessel can be reached with<br>
greater facility, owing to its comparatively superficial situation. The<br>
inner border of the supinator muscle, G, Plate 16, is the guide to the<br>
radial artery; and the outer margin of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle,<br>
K, Plate 16, indicates the locality of the ulnar artery. Both arteries,<br>
I, K, Plate 15, at the wrist, lie beneath the fascia. If either of these<br>
vessels require a ligature in this region of the arm, the operation may<br>
be performed with little trouble, as a simple incision over the track of<br>
the vessels, through the skin and the fascia, will readily expose each.<br>
<br>
Whenever circumstances may call for placing a ligature on the ulnar<br>
artery, as it lies between the superficial and deep flexor muscles, in<br>
the region of I L M, Plate 16, the course of the vessel may be indicated<br>
by a line drawn from a central point of the forearm, an inch or so below<br>
the level of the inner condyle--viz., the point F, and carried to the<br>
pisiform bone, T. The line of incision will divide obliquely the<br>
superficial flexors; and, on a full exposure of the vessel in this<br>
situation, the median nerve will be seen to cross the artery at an acute<br>
angle, in order to gain the mid-place in the wrist at Q. The ulnar<br>
nerve, <span style="font-style: italic;">d,</span> Plate 16, passing
behind the inner condyle, <span style="font-style: italic;">e,</span>
does not come<br>
into connexion with the ulnar artery until both arrive at the place O.<br>
It will, however, be considered an awkward proceeding to subject to<br>
transverse section so large a mass of muscles as the superficial flexors<br>
of the forearm, when the vessel may be more readily reached elsewhere,<br>
and perhaps with equal advantage as to the locality of the ligature.<br>
<br>
When either the radial or ulnar arteries happen to be completely divided<br>
in a wound, both ends of the vessel will bleed alike, in consequence of<br>
the free anastomosis of both arteries in the hand.<br>
