<big><big>COMMENTARY ON PLATES 13 &amp; 14.<br>
THE SURGICAL FORM OF THE MALE AND FEMALE AXILLAE COMPARED.<br>
<br>
Certain characteristic features mark those differences which are to be<br>
found in all corresponding regions of both sexes. Though the male and<br>
female bodies, in all their regions, are anatomically homologous or<br>
similar at basis, yet the constituent and corresponding organs of each<br>
are gently diversified by the plus or minus condition, the more or the<br>
less, which the development of certain organs exhibits; and this<br>
diversity, viewed in the aggregate, constitutes the sexual difference.<br>
That diversity which defines the sexual character of beings of the same<br>
species, is but a link in that extended chain of differential gradation<br>
which marks its progress through the whole animal kingdom. The female<br>
breast is a plus glandular organ, situated, pendent, in that very<br>
position where, in a male body, the unevolved mamma is still<br>
rudimentarily manifested.<br>
<br>
The male and female axillae contain the same number and species of<br>
organs; and the difference by which the external configuration of both<br>
are marked mainly arises from the presence of the enlarged mammary<br>
gland, which, in the female, Plate 14, masks the natural outline of the<br>
pectoral muscle, E, whose axillary border is overhung by the gland; and<br>
thus this region derives its peculiarity of form, contrasted with that<br>
of the male subject.<br>
<br>
When the dissected axilla is viewed from below, the arm being raised,<br>
and extended from the side, its contained parts, laid deeply in their<br>
conical recess, are sufficiently exposed, at the same time that the<br>
proper boundaries of the axillary cavity are maintained. In this point<br>
of view from which the axillary vessels are now seen, their relative<br>
position, in respect to the thorax and the arm, are best displayed. The<br>
thickness of that fleshy anterior boundary formed by both pectoral<br>
muscles, E F, Plate 13, will be marked as considerable; and the depth at<br>
which these muscles conceal the vessels, A B, in the front aspect of the<br>
thoracico-humeral interval, will prepare the surgeon for the<br>
difficulties he is to encounter when proceeding to ligature the axillary<br>
artery at the incision made through the anterior or pectoral wall of<br>
this axillary space.<br>
<br>
The bloodvessels of the axilla follow the motions of the arm; and<br>
according to the position assumed by the arm, these vessels describe<br>
various curves, and lie more or less removed from the side of the<br>
thorax. While the arm hangs close to the side, the axillary space does<br>
not (properly speaking) exist; and in this position, the axillary<br>
vessels and nerves make a general curve from the clavicle at the point<br>
K, Plate 14, to the inner side of the arm, the concavity of the curve<br>
being turned towards the thoracic side. But when the arm is abducted<br>
from the side, and elevated, the vessels which are destined to supply<br>
the limb follow it, and in this position they take, in reality, a<br>
serpentine course; the first curve of which is described, in reference<br>
to the thorax, from the point K to the head of the humerus; and the next<br>
is that bend which the head of the humerus, projecting into the axilla<br>
in the elevated position of the member, forces them to make around<br>
itself in their passage to the inner side of the arm. The vessels may be<br>
readily compressed against the upper third of the humerus by the finger,<br>
passed into the axilla, and still more effectually if the arm be raised,<br>
as this motion will rotate the tuberous head of the humerus downwards<br>
against them.<br>
<br>
The vessels and nerves of the axilla are bound together by a fibrous<br>
sheath derived from the membrane called costo-coracoid; and the base or<br>
humeral outlet of this axillary space, described by the muscles C, K, E,<br>
G, Plate 13, is closed by a part of the fascial membrane, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g,</span> extended<br>
across from the pectoral muscle, E, to the latissimus dorsi tendon, K.<br>
In the natural position of the vessels at that region of their course<br>
represented in the Plates, the vein A overlies the artery B, and also<br>
conceals most of the principal nerves. In order to show some of these<br>
nerves, in contact with the artery itself, the axillary vein is drawn a<br>
little apart from them.<br>
<br>
The axillary space gives lodgment to numerous lymphatic glands, which<br>
are either directly suspended from the main artery, or from its<br>
principal branches, by smaller branches, destined to supply them. These<br>
glands are more numerous in the female axilla, Plate 14, than in the<br>
male, Plate 13, and while they seem to be, as it were, indiscriminately<br>
scattered here and there through this region, we observe the greater<br>
number of them to be gathered together along the axillary side of the<br>
great pectoral muscle; at which situation, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h,</span> in the diseased condition<br>
of the female breast, they will be felt to form hard, nodulated masses,<br>
which frequently extend as far up through the axillary space as the root<br>
of the neck, involving the glands of this latter region also in the<br>
disease.<br>
<br>
The contractile motions of the pectoral muscle, E, of the male body,<br>
Plate 13, are during life readily distinguishable; and that boundary<br>
which it furnishes to the axillary region is well defined; but in the<br>
female form, Plate 14, the general contour of the muscle E, while in<br>
motion, is concealed by the hemispherical mammary gland, F, which,<br>
surrounded by its proper capsule, lies loosely pendent from the fore<br>
part of the muscle, to which, in the healthy state of the organ, it is<br>
connected only by free-moving bonds of lax cellular membrane. The<br>
motions of the shoulder upon the trunk do not influence the position of<br>
the female mammary gland, for the pectoral muscle acts freely beneath<br>
it; but when a scirrhus or other malignant growth involves the mammary<br>
organ, and this latter contracts, by the morbid mass, a close adhesion<br>
to the muscle, then these motions are performed with pain and<br>
difficulty.<br>
<br>
When it is required to excise the diseased female breast, (supposing the<br>
disease to be confined to the structure of the gland itself,) the<br>
operation may be performed confidently and without difficulty, in so far<br>
as the seat of operation does not involve the immediate presence of any<br>
important nerves or bloodvessels. But when the disease has extended to<br>
the axillary glands, the extirpation of these (as they lie in such close<br>
proximity to the great axillary vessels and their principal branches)<br>
requires cautious dissection. It has more than once happened to eminent<br>
surgeons, that in searching for and dissecting out these diseased<br>
axillary glands, H, <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, Plate
14, the main artery has been wounded.<br>
<br>
As the coracoid process points to the situation of the artery in the<br>
axilla, so the coraco-brachialis muscle, C, marks the exact locality of<br>
the vessel as it emerges from this region; the artery ranges along the<br>
inner margin of both the process and the muscle, which latter, in fleshy<br>
bodies, sometimes overhangs and conceals it. When the vessel has passed<br>
the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, it becomes situated at the inner<br>
side of the biceps, which also partly overlaps it, as it now lies on the<br>
forepart of the brachialis&nbsp; anticus. As the general course of the<br>
artery, from where it leaves the axilla to the bend of the elbow, is one<br>
of winding from the inner side to the forepart of the limb, so should<br>
compression of the vessel, when necessary, be directed in reference to<br>
the bone accordingly--viz., in the upper or axillary region of the arm,<br>
from within outwards, and in the lower part of the arm, from before<br>
backwards.<br>
<br>
All incised, lacerated, or contused wounds of the arm and shoulder,<br>
happening by pike, bayonet, sabre, bullet, mace, or arrow, on the outer<br>
aspect of the limb, are (provided the weapon has not broken the bones)<br>
less likely to implicate the great arteries, veins, and nerves. These<br>
instruments encountering the inner or axillary aspect of the member,<br>
will of course be more likely to involve the vessels and nerves in the<br>
wound. In severe compound fractures of the humerus occurring from force<br>
applied at the external side of the limb, the brachial vessels and<br>
nerves have been occasionally lacerated by the sharp jagged ends of the<br>
broken bone,--a circumstance which calls for immediate amputation of the<br>
member.<br>
<br>
The axilla becomes very frequently the seat of morbid growths, which,<br>
when they happen to be situated beneath the dense axillary fascia, and<br>
have attained to a large size, will press upon the vessels and nerves of<br>
this region, and cause very great inconvenience. Adipose and other kind<br>
of tumours occurring in the axilla beneath the fascia, and in close<br>
contact with the main vessels, have been known to obstruct these vessels<br>
to such a degree, as to require the collateral or anastomatic<br>
circulation to be set up for the support; of the limb. When abscesses<br>
take place in the axilla, beneath the fascia, it is this structure which<br>
will prevent the matter from pointing; and it is required, therefore, to<br>
lay this fascia freely open by a timely incision. The accompanying<br>
Plates will indicate the proper direction in which such incision should<br>
be made, so as to avoid the vessels A, B. When the limb is abducted from<br>
the side, the main vessels and nerves take their position parallel with<br>
the axis of the arm. The axillary vessels and nerves being thus liable<br>
to pressure from the presence of large tumours happening in their<br>
neighbourhood, will suggest to the practitioner the necessity for<br>
fashioning of a proper form and size all apparatus, which in fracture or<br>
dislocation of the shoulder-bones shall be required to bear forcibly<br>
against the axillary region. While we know that the locality of the main<br>
vessels and nerves is that very situation upon which a pad or fulcrum<br>
presses, when placed in the axilla for securing the reduction of<br>
fractures of the clavicle, the neck of the humerus, or scapula, so<br>
should this member of the fracture apparatus be adapted, as well to<br>
obviate this pressure upon these structures, as to give the needful<br>
support to the limb in reference to the clavicle, &amp;c. The habitual
use,<br>
for weeks or more, of a hard, resisting fulcrum in the axilla, must act<br>
in some degree like the pad of a tourniquet, arresting the flow of a<br>
vigorous circulation, which is so essential to the speedy union of all<br>
lesions of bones. And it should never be lost sight of, that all<br>
grievously coercive apparatus, which incommode the suffering patient,<br>
under treatment, are those very instruments which impede the curative<br>
process of Nature herself.<br>
<br>
The anatomical mechanism of the human body, considered as a whole, or<br>
divisible into regions, forms a study so closely bearing upon practice,<br>
that the surgeon, if he be not also a mechanician, and fully capable of<br>
making his anatomical knowledge suit with the common principles of<br>
mechanics, while devising methods for furthering the efforts, of Nature<br>
curatively, may be said to have studied anatomy to little or no purpose.<br>
The shoulder apparatus, when studied through the principle of mechanics,<br>
derives an interest of practical import which all the laboured<br>
description of the schools could never supply to it, except when<br>
illustrating this principle.<br>
<br>
The disposal of the muscular around the osseous elements of the shoulder<br>
apparatus, forms a study for the surgeon as well in the abnormal<br>
condition of these parts, as in their normal arrangement; for in<br>
practice he discovers that that very mechanical principle upon which<br>
both orders of structures (the osseous and muscular) are grouped<br>
together for normal articular action, becomes, when the parts are<br>
deranged by fracture or, other accident, the chief cause whereby<br>
rearrangement is prevented, and the process of reunion obstructed. When<br>
a fracture happens in the shaft of the humerus, above or below the<br>
insertions of the pectoral and latissimus dorsi muscles, these are the<br>
very agents which when the bone possessed its integrity rendered it<br>
functionally fitting, and which, now that the bone is severed, produce<br>
the displacement of the lower fragment from the upper one. To counteract<br>
this source of derangement, the surgeon becomes the mechanician, and<br>
now, for the first time, he recognises the necessity of the study of<br>
topographical anatomy.<br>
<br>
When a bone is fractured, or dislocated to a false position and retained<br>
there by the muscular force, the surgeon counteracts this force upon<br>
mechanical principle; but while he puts this principle in operation, he<br>
also acknowledges to the paramount necessity of ministering to the ease<br>
of Nature as much as shall be consistent with the effectual use of the<br>
remedial agent; and in the present state of knowledge, it is owned, that<br>
that apparatus is most efficient which simply serves both objects, the<br>
one no less than the other. And, assuming this to be the principle which<br>
should always guide us in our treatment of fractures and dislocations, I<br>
shall not hesitate to say, that the pad acting as a fulcrum in the<br>
axilla, or the perineal band bearing as a counterextending force upon<br>
the groin (the suffering body of the patient being, in both instances,<br>
subjected for weeks together to the grievous pressure and irritation of<br>
these members of the apparatus), do not serve both objects, and only one<br>
incompletely; I say incompletely, for out of every six fractures of<br>
either clavicle or thigh-bone, I believe that, as the result of our<br>
treatment by the present forms of mechanical contrivances, there would<br>
not be found three cases of coaptation of the broken ends of the bone so<br>
complete as to do credit to the surgeon. The most pliant and portable of<br>
all forms of apparatus which constitute the hospital armamentaria, is<br>
the judgment; and this cannot give its approval to any plan of<br>
instrument which takes effect only at the expense of the patient.<br>
