DEFORMITIES OF THE URINARY BLADDER.--THE OPERATIONS OF SOUNDING FOR<br>
STONE, OF CATHETERISM AND OF PUNCTURING THE BLADDER ABOVE THE PUBES.<br>
<br>
The urinary bladder presents two kinds of deformity--viz., congenital<br>
and pathological. As examples of the former may be mentioned that in<br>
which the organ is deficient in front, and has become everted and<br>
protruded like a fungous mass through an opening at the median line of<br>
the hypogastrium; that in which the rectum terminates in the bladder<br>
posteriorly; and that in which the foetal urachus remains pervious as a<br>
uniform canal, or assumes a sacculated shape between the summit of the<br>
bladder and the umbilicus. The pathological deformities are, those in<br>
which vesical fistulae, opening either above the pubes, at the<br>
perinaeum, or into the rectum, have followed abscesses or the operation<br>
of puncturing the bladder in these situations, and those in which the<br>
walls of the organ appear thickened and contracted, or thinned and<br>
expanded, or sacculated externally, or ridged internally, in consequence<br>
of its having been subjected to abdominal pressure while overdistended<br>
with its contents, and while incapable of voiding these from some<br>
permanent obstruction in the urethral canal.[Footnote] The bladder is<br>
liable to become sacculated from two causes--from a hernial protrusion<br>
of its mucous membrane through the separated fasciculi of its fibrous<br>
coat, or from the cyst of an abscess which has formed a communication<br>
with the bladder, and received the contents of this organ. Sacs, when<br>
produced in the former way, may be of any number, or size, or in any<br>
situation; when caused by an abscess, the sac is single, is generally<br>
formed in the prostate, or corresponds to the base of the bladder, and<br>
may attain to a size equalling, or even exceeding, that of the bladder<br>
itself. The sac, however formed, will be found lined by mucous membrane.<br>
The cyst of an abscess, when become a recipient for the urine, assumes<br>
after a time a lining membrane similar to that of the bladder. If the<br>
sac be situated at the summit or back of the bladder, it will be found<br>
invested by peritonaeum; but, whatever be its size, structure, or<br>
position, it may be always distinguished from the bladder by being<br>
devoid of the fibrous tunic, and by having but an indirect relation to<br>
the vesical orifice.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: On considering these cases of physical impediments to the<br>
passage of urine from the vesical reservoir through the urethral<br>
conduit, it seems to me as if these were sufficient to account for the<br>
formation of stone in the bladder, or any other part of the urinary<br>
apparatus, without the necessity of ascribing it to a constitutional<br>
disease, such as that named the <span style="font-style: italic;">lithic
diathesis </span>by the humoral<br>
pathologists.<br>
<br>
The urinary apparatus (consisting of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and<br>
urethra) is known to be the principal emunctory for eliminating and<br>
voiding the detritus formed by the continual decay of the parts<br>
comprising the animal economy. The urine is this detritus in a state of<br>
solution. The components of urine are chemically similar to those of<br>
calculi, and as the components of the one vary according to the<br>
disintegration occurring at the time in the vital alembic, so do those<br>
of the other. While, therefore, a calculus is only as urine precipitated<br>
and solidified, and this fluid only as calculous matter suspended in a<br>
menstruum, it must appear that the lithic diathesis is as natural and<br>
universal as structural disintegration is constant and general in<br>
operation. As every individual, therefore, may be said to void day by<br>
day a dissolved calculus, it must follow that its form of precipitation<br>
within some part of the urinary apparatus alone constitutes the disease,<br>
since in this form it cannot be passed. On viewing the subject in this<br>
light, the question that springs directly is, (while the lithic<br>
diathesis is common to individuals of all ages and both sexes,) why the<br>
lithic sediment should present in the form of concrement in some and not<br>
in others? The principal, if not the sole, cause of this seems to me to<br>
be obstruction to the free egress of the urine along the natural<br>
passage. Aged individuals of the male sex, in whom the prostate is prone<br>
to enlargement, and the urethra to organic stricture, are hence more<br>
subject to the formation of stone in the bladder, than youths, in whom<br>
these causes of obstruction are less frequent, or than females of any<br>
age, in whom the prostate is absent, and the urethra simple, short,<br>
readily dilatable, and seldom or never strictured. When an obstruction<br>
exists, lithic concretions take place in the urinary apparatus in the<br>
same manner as sedimentary particles cohere or crystallize elsewhere.<br>
The urine becoming pent up and stagnant while charged with saline<br>
matter, either deposits this around a nucleus introduced into it, or as<br>
a surplus when the menstruum is insufficient to suspend it. The most<br>
depending part of the bladder is that where lithic concretions take<br>
place; and if a sacculus exist here, this, becoming a recipient for the<br>
matter, will favour the formation of stone.] [End Footnote]<br>

FIG. 1, Plate 63.--The lateral lobes of the prostate, 3, 4, are<br>
enlarged, and contract the prostatic canal. Behind them the third lobe<br>
of smaller size occupies the vesical orifice, and completes the<br>
obstruction. The walls of the bladder have hence become fasciculated and<br>
sacculated. One sac, 1, projects from the summit of the bladder;<br>
another, 2, containing a stone, projects laterally. When a stone<br>
occupies a sac, it does not give rise to the usual symptoms as<br>
indicating its presence, nor can it be always detected by the sound.<br>

Plate 63,--Figure 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
FIG. 2, Plate 63.--The prostate, 2, 3, is enlarged, and the middle lobe,<br>
2, appears bending the prostatic canal to an almost vertical position,<br>
and obstructing the vesical orifice. The bladder, 1, 1, 1, is thickened;<br>
the ureters, 7, are dilated; and a large sac, 6, 6, projects from the<br>
base of the bladder backwards, and occupies the recto-vesical fossa. The<br>
sac, equal in size to the bladder, communicates with this organ by a<br>
small circular opening, 8, situated between the orifices of the ureters.<br>
The peritonaeum is reflected from the summit of the bladder to that of<br>
the sac. A catheter, 4, appears perforating the third lobe of the<br>
prostate, 2, and entering the sac, 5, through the base of the bladder,<br>
below the opening, 8. In a case of this kind, a catheter occupying the<br>
position 4, 5, would, while voiding the bladder through the sac, make it<br>
seem as if it really traversed the vesical orifice. If a stone occupied<br>
the bladder, the point of the instrument in the sac could not detect it,<br>
whereas, if a stone lay within the sac, the instrument, on striking it<br>
here, would give the impression as if it lay within the bladder.<br>

Plate 63,--Figure 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
FIG. 3, Plate 63.--The urethra being strictured, the bladder has become<br>
sacculated. In the bas fond of the bladder appears a circular opening,<br>
2, leading to a sac of large dimensions, which rested against the<br>
rectum. In such a case as this, the sac, occupying a lower position than<br>
the base of the bladder, must first become the recipient of the urine,<br>
and retain this fluid even after the bladder has been evacuated, either<br>
voluntarily or by means of instruments. If, in such a state of the<br>
parts, retention of urine called for puncturation, it is evident that<br>
this operation would be performed with greater effect by opening the<br>
depending sac through the bowel, than by entering the summit of the<br>
bladder above the pubes.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
FIG. 4, Plate 63.--The vesical orifice is obstructed by two portions, 3,<br>
4, of the prostate, projecting upwards, one from each of its lateral<br>
lobes, 6, 6. The bladder is thickened and fasciculated, and from its<br>
summit projects a double sac, 1, 2, which is invested by the<br>
peritonaeum.<br>
<br>

<big><big><br>
FIG. 5, Plate 63.--The prostatic canal is constricted and bent upwards<br>
by the third lobe. The bladder is thickened, and its base is dilated in<br>
the form of a sac, which is dependent, and upon which rests a calculus.<br>
An instrument enters the bladder by perforating the third lobe, but does<br>
not come into contact with the calculus, owing to the low position<br>
occupied by this body.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 63,--Figure 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
FIG. 6, Plate 63.--Two sacs appear projecting on either side of the base<br>
of the bladder. The right one, 5, contains a calculus, 6; the left one,<br>
of larger dimensions, is empty. The rectum lay in contact with the base<br>
of the bladder between the two sacs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="images/140P63F6_25.jpg"><img alt=""

Plate 63,--Figure 6.<br>
<br>
<br>
FIG. 7, Plate 63.--Four calculi are contained in the bladder. This organ<br>
is divided by two septa, 2, 4, into three compartments, each of which,<br>
1, 3, 5, gives lodgment to a calculus; and another, 6, of these bodies<br>
lies impacted in the prostatic canal, and becomes a complete bar to the<br>
passage of a catheter. Supposing lithotomy to be performed in an<br>
instance of this kind, it is probable that, after the extraction of the<br>
calculi, 6, 5, the two upper ones, 3, 1, would, owing to their being<br>
embedded in the walls of the bladder, escape the forceps.<br>
<br>

Plate 63,--Figure 7.<br>
<br>
<br>
FIG. 8, Plate 63.-Two large polypi, and many smaller ones, appear<br>
growing from the mucous membrane of the prostatic urethra and vesical<br>
orifice, and obstructing these parts. In examining this case during life<br>
by the sound, the two larger growths, 1, 2, were mistaken by the surgeon<br>
for calculi. Such a mistake might well be excused if they happened to be<br>
encrusted with lithic matter.<br>
<br>

Plate 63,--Figure 8.<br>
<br>
<br>
FIG. 9, Plate 63.--The base of the bladder, 8, 8, appears dilated into a<br>
large uniform sac, and separated from the upper part of the organ by a<br>
circular horizontal fold, 2, 2. The ureters are also dilated. The left<br>
ureter, 3, 4, opens into the sac below this fold, while the right ureter<br>
opens above it into the bladder. In all cases of retention of urine from<br>
permanent obstruction of the urethra, the ureters are generally found<br>
more or less dilated. Two circumstances combine to this effect--while<br>
the renal secretion continues to pass into the ureters from above, the<br>
contents of the bladder under abdominal pressure are forced<br>
regurgitating into them from below, through their orifices.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
FIG. 1, Plate 64.--The bladder, 6, appears symmetrically sacculated. One<br>
sac, 1, is formed at its summit, others, 3, 2, project laterally, and<br>
two more, 5, 4, from its base. The ureters, 7, 7, are dilated, and enter<br>
the bladder between the lateral and inferior sacs.<br>
<br>

<br>
Fig. 2, Plate 64.--The prostate is greatly enlarged, and forms a narrow<br>
ring around the vesical orifice. Through this an instrument, 12, enters<br>
the bladder. The walls of the bladder are thickened and sacculated. On<br>
its left side appear numerous sacs, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and on the<br>
inner surface of its right side appear the orifices of as many more. On<br>
its summit another sac is formed. The ureters, 9, are dilated.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
FIG. 3, Plate 64.--The prostate is enlarged, its canal is narrowed, and<br>
the bladder is thickened and contracted. A calculus, 1, 2, appears<br>
occupying nearly the whole vesical interior. The incision in the neck of<br>
the bladder in lithotomy must necessarily be extensive, to admit of the<br>
extraction of a stone of this size.<br>
<br>

Plate 64,--Figure 3.<br>
<br>
FIG. 4, Plate 64.--The prostatic canal is contracted by the lateral<br>
lobes, 4, 5; resting upon these, appear three calculi, 1, 2, 3, which<br>
nearly fill the bladder. This organ is thickened and fasciculated. In<br>
cases of this kind, and that last mentioned, the presence of stone is<br>
readily ascertainable by the sound.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 64,--Figure 4.<br>
<br>
FIG. 5, Plate 64.--The three prostatic lobes are enlarged, and appear<br>
contracting the vesical orifice. In the walls of the bladder are<br>
embedded several small calculi, 2, 2, 2, 2, which, on being struck with<br>
the convex side of a sound, might give the impression as though a single<br>
stone of large size existed. In performing lithotomy, these calculi<br>
would not be within reach of the forceps.<br>
<br>

Plate 64,--Figure 5.<br>
<br>
FIG. 6, Plate 64.--Two sacculi, 4, 5, appear projecting at the middle<br>
line of the base of the bladder, between the vasa deferentia, 7, 7, and<br>
behind the prostate, in the situation where the operation of puncturing<br>
the bladder per anum is recommended to be performed in retention of<br>
urine.<br>
<br>

Plate 64,--Figure 6.<br>
<br>
FIG. 7, Plate 64.--A sac, 4, is situated on the left side of the<br>
bladder, 3, 3, immediately above the orifice of the ureter. In the sac<br>
was contained a mass of phosphatic calculus. This substance is said to<br>
be secreted by the mucous lining of the bladder, while in a state of<br>
chronic inflammation, but there seems nevertheless very good reason for<br>
us to believe that it is, like all other calculous matter, a deposit<br>
from the urine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="images/140P64F7_25.jpg"><img alt=""

Plate 64,--Figure 7.<br>
<br>
<br>
FIG. 8, Plate 64, represents, in section, the relative position of the<br>
parts concerned in catheterism. [Footnote] In performing this operation,<br>
the patient is to be laid supine; his loins are to be supported on a<br>
pillow; and his thighs are to be flexed and drawn apart from each other.<br>
By this means the perinaeum is brought fully into view, and its<br>
structures are made to assume a fixed relative position. The operator,<br>
standing on the patient's left side, is now to raise the penis so as to<br>
render the urethra, 8, 8, 8, as straight as possible between the meatus,<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, and the bulb, 7. The
instrument (the concavity of its curve being<br>
turned to the left groin) is now to be inserted into the meatus, and<br>
while being gently impelled through the canal, the urethra is to be<br>
drawn forwards, by the left hand, over the instrument. By stretching the<br>
urethra, we render its sides sufficiently tense for facilitating the<br>
passage of the instrument, and the orifices of the lacunae become<br>
closed. While the instrument is being passed along this part of the<br>
canal, its point should be directed fairly towards the urethral opening,<br>
6*, of the triangular ligament, which is situated an inch or so below<br>
the pubic symphysis, 11. With this object in view, we should avoid<br>
depressing its handle as yet, lest its point be prematurely tilted up,<br>
and rupture the upper side of the urethra anterior to the ligament. As<br>
soon as the instrument has arrived at the bulb, its further progress is<br>
liable to be arrested, from these causes:--1st, This portion of the<br>
canal is the lowest part of its perinaeal curve, 3, 6, 8, and is closely<br>
embraced by the middle fibres of the accelerator urinae muscle. 2nd, It<br>
is immediately succeeded by the commencement of the membranous urethra,<br>
which, while being naturally narrower than other parts, is also the more<br>
usual seat of organic stricture, and is subject to spasmodic<br>
constriction by the fibres of the compressor urethrae. 3d, The<br>
triangular ligament is behind it, and if the urethral opening of the<br>
ligament be not directly entered by the instrument, this will bend the<br>
urethra against the front of that dense structure. On ascertaining these<br>
to be the causes of resistance, the instrument is to be withdrawn a<br>
little in the canal, so as to admit of its being readjusted for engaging<br>
precisely the opening in the triangular ligament. As this structure, 6,<br>
is attached to the membranous urethra, 6*, which perforates it, both<br>
these parts may be rendered tense, by drawing the penis forwards, and<br>
thereby the instrument may be guided towards and through the aperture.<br>
The instrument having passed the ligament, regard is now to be paid to<br>
the direction of the pelvic portion of the canal, which is upwards and<br>
backwards to the vesical orifice, 3, <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>,
3. In order that the point of<br>
the instrument may freely traverse the urethra in this direction, its<br>
handle, <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, requires to be
depressed,<span style="font-style: italic;"> b c</span>, slowly towards
the perinaeum,<br>
and at the same time to be impelled steadily back in the line <span
 style="font-style: italic;">d, d,</span><br>
through the pubic arch, 11. If the third lobe of the prostate happen to<br>
be enlarged, the vesical orifice will accordingly be more elevated than<br>
usual. In this case, it becomes necessary to depress the instrument to a<br>
greater extent than is otherwise required, so that its point may<br>
surmount the obstacle. But since the suspensory ligament of the penis,<br>
10, and the perinaeal structures prevent the handle being depressed<br>
beyond a certain degree, which is insufficient for the object to be<br>
attained, the instrument should possess the<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> prostatic curve, c c,</span><br>
compared with <span style="font-style: italic;">c b</span>.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: It may be necessary for me to state that, with the exception<br>
of this figure (which is obviously a plan, but sufficiently accurate for<br>
the purposes it is intended to serve) all the others representing<br>
pathological conditions and congenital deformities of the urethra, the<br>
prostate, and the bladder, have been made by myself from <span
 style="font-style: italic;">natural</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">specimens</span> in the museums and
hospitals of London and Paris.]<br>

Plate 64,--Figure 8.<br>
<br>
In the event of its being impossible to pass a catheter by the urethra,<br>
in cases of retention of urine threatening rupture, the base or the<br>
summit of the bladder, according as either part may be reached with the<br>
greater safety to the peritonaeal sac, will require to be punctured. If<br>
the prostate be greatly and irregularly enlarged, it will be safer to<br>
puncture the bladder above the pubes, and here the position of the organ<br>
in regard to the peritonaeum, 1, becomes the chief consideration. The<br>
shape of the bladder varies very considerably from its state of<br>
collapse, 3, 3, 5, to those of mediate, 3, 3, 2, 1, and extreme<br>
distention, 3, 3, 4. This change of form is chiefly effected by the<br>
expansive elevation of its upper half, which is invested by the<br>
peritonaeum. As the summit of the bladder falls below, and rises above<br>
the level of the upper margin of the pubic symphysis, it carries the<br>
peritonaeum with it in either direction. While the bladder is fully<br>
expanded, 4, there occurs an interval between the margin of the<br>
symphysis pubis and the point of reflexion of the peritonaeum, from the<br>
recti muscles, to the summit of the viscus. At this interval, close to<br>
the pubes, and in the median line, the trocar may be safely passed<br>
through the front wall of the bladder. The instrument should, in all<br>
cases, be directed downwards and backwards, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">h, h</span>, in a line pointing to<br>
the hollow of the sacrum.<br>
