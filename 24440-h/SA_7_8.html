<big><big>COMMENTARY ON PLATES 7 &amp; 8.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE SUBCLAVIAN AND CAROTID REGIONS,<br>
THE RELATIVE ANATOMY OF THEIR CONTENTS.<br>
<br>
<br>
A perfect knowledge of the relative anatomy of any of the surgical<br>
regions of the body must include an acquaintance with the superposition<br>
of parts contained in each region, as well as the plane relationship of<br>
organs which hold the same level in each layer or anatomical stratum.<br>
The dissections in Plates 7 and 8 exhibit both these modes of relation.<br>
A portion of each of those superficial layers, which it was necessary to<br>
divide, in order to expose a deeper organ, has been left holding its<br>
natural level. Thus the order of superposition taken by the integument,<br>
the fasciae, the muscles, bones, veins, nerves, and arteries, which<br>
occupy both the surgical triangles of the neck, will be readily<br>
recognised in the opposite Plates.<br>
<br>
The depth of a bloodvessel or other organ from surface will vary for<br>
many reasons, even though the same parts in the natural order of<br>
superposition shall overlie the whole length of the vessel or organ<br>
which we make search for. The principal of those reasons are:--1st, that<br>
the stratified organs themselves vary in thickness at several places;<br>
2d, that the organ or vessel which we seek will itself incline to<br>
surface from deeper levels occupied elsewhere; 3d, that the normal<br>
undulations of surface will vary the depth of the particular vessels,<br>
&amp;c.; and 4th, that the natural mobility of the superimposed parts
will<br>
allow them to change place in some measure, and consequently influence<br>
the relative position of the object of search. On this account it is<br>
that the surgical anatomist chooses to give a fixed position to the<br>
subject about to be operated on, in order to reduce the number of these<br>
difficulties as much as possible.<br>
<br>
In Plate 7 will be seen the surgical relationship of parts lying in the<br>
vicinity of the common carotid artery, at the point of its bifurcation<br>
into external and internal carotids. At this locality, the vessel will<br>
be found, in general, subjacent to the following mentioned structures,<br>
numbered from the superficies to its own level--viz., the common<br>
integument and subcutaneous adipose membrane, which will vary in<br>
thickness in several individuals; next, the platysma myoides muscle, F<br>
L, which is identified with the superficial fascia, investing the outer<br>
surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle; next, the deeper layer of the same<br>
fascia, R S., which passes beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, but over<br>
the sheath of the vessels; and next, the sheath of the vessels, Q, which<br>
invests them and isolates them from adjacent structures. Though the<br>
vessel lies deeper than the level of the sterno-mastoid muscle at this<br>
locality, yet it is not covered by the muscle in the same manner, as it<br>
is lower down in the neck. At this place, therefore, though the actual<br>
depth of the artery from surface will be the same, whether it be covered<br>
or uncovered by the sterno-mastoid muscle, still we know that the<br>
locality of the vessel relative to the parts actually superimposed will<br>
vary accordingly. This observation will apply to the situation and<br>
relative position of all the other vessels as well. Other occurrences<br>
will vary the relations of the artery in regard to superjacent<br>
structures, though the actual depth of the vessel from surface may be<br>
the same. If the internal jugular vein covers the carotid artery, as it<br>
sometimes does, or if a plexus of veins, gathering from the fore-part of<br>
the neck or face, overlie the vessel, or if a chain of lymphatic bodies<br>
be arranged upon it, as is frequently the case, the knowledge of such<br>
occurrences will guard the judgment against being led into error by the<br>
conventionalities of the descriptive method of anatomists. The normal<br>
relative anatomy of the bloodvessels is taken by anatomists to be the<br>
more frequent disposition of their main trunks and branches, considered<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>, and in connexion with
neighbouring parts. But it will be seen by<br>
this avowal that those vessels are liable to many various conditions;<br>
and such is the case, in fact. No anatomist can pronounce with exactness<br>
the precise figure of vessels or other organs while they lie concealed<br>
beneath the surface. An approach to truth is all that the best<br>
experience can boast of. The form and relations of the carotid vessels<br>
of Plate 7 may or may not be the same as those concealed beneath the<br>
same region of Plate 8, at the point R.<br>
<br>
The motions of the head upon the neck, or of the neck upon the trunk,<br>
will influence the relative position of the vessels A C B, of Plate 7,<br>
and therefore we take a fixed surgical position, in the expectation of<br>
finding that the carotid artery projects from under the anterior border<br>
of the upper third of the sterno-mastoid muscle, opposite the upper<br>
border of the thyroid cartilage; at this situation of the vessels, viz.,<br>
R, Plate 8, opposite O, the thyroid projection, is in general to be<br>
found the anatomical relation of the vessels as they appear dissected in<br>
Plate 7. Of these vessels, the main trunks are less liable to anomalous<br>
character than the minor branches.<br>
<br>
The relative position of the subclavian artery is as liable to be<br>
influenced by the motions of the clavicle on the sternum, as that of the<br>
carotid is by the motions of the lower jaw-bone on the skull, or by the<br>
larynx, in its own motions at the fore-part of the neck. It becomes as<br>
necessary, therefore, in the performance of surgical operations upon the<br>
subclavian artery, to fix the clavicle by depressing it, as in Plate 8,<br>
as it is to give fixity to the lower maxilla and larynx, in the position<br>
of Plate 7, when the carotid is the subject of operation.<br>
<br>
The same named structures, but different as to their parts, will be<br>
found to overlie the subclavian artery as are found to conceal the<br>
carotid artery. The skin, the fascia, and platysma muscle, the<br>
sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, the deep layer of the cervical fascia,<br>
&amp;c., cover both vessels. One additional muscle binds down the
subclavian<br>
artery, viz., the scalenus anticus. The omo-hyoid relates to both<br>
vessels, the anterior division to the carotid, the posterior to the<br>
subclavian.<br>
<br>
The carotid artery lies uncovered by the sterno-mastoid muscle, opposite<br>
to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, or the hyoid bone; and the<br>
subclavian artery emerges from under cover of a different part of the<br>
same muscle, opposite the middle of the clavicle. These points of<br>
relationship to the skeletal parts can be ascertained by the touch, in<br>
both instances, even in the undissected body. The thyroid point, O, of<br>
Plate 8, indicates the line, R N, which the carotid artery traverses in<br>
the same figure, along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle,<br>
as seen in the dissected region of Plate 7. The mid-point of the<br>
clavicle, U, Plate 7, and the top of the sternum in the same figure,<br>
will, while the eye follows the arching line, Z X T V, indicate with<br>
correctness the arching course of the subclavian, such as is represented<br>
in the dissection of that vessel, B, Plate 8.<br>
<br>
The subclavian artery has no special sheath, properly so called; but the<br>
deep layer of the cervical fascia, P, Plate 8, which passes under A, the<br>
clavicular portion of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and becomes of<br>
considerable thickness and density, sheaths over the vessel in this<br>
region of its course.<br>
<br>
A very complex condition of the veins which join the external jugular at<br>
this part of the course of the subclavian artery is now and then to be<br>
found overlying that vessel. If the hemorrhage consequent upon the<br>
opening of these veins, or that of the external jugular, be so profuse<br>
as to impede the operation of ligaturing the subclavian artery, it may<br>
in some measure be arrested by compressing them against the resisting<br>
parts adjacent, when the operator, feeling for D, the scalenus muscle,<br>
and the first rib to which it is attached, cannot fail to alight upon<br>
the main artery itself, B, Plate 8.<br>
<br>
The middle of the shaft of the clavicle is a much safer guide to the<br>
vessel than are the muscles which contribute to form this posterior<br>
triangle of the neck, in which the subclavian vessel is located. The<br>
form or position of the clavicle in the depressed condition of the<br>
shoulder, as seen in Plate 8, is invariable; whereas that of the<br>
trapezius and sterno-mastoid muscles is inconstant, these muscles being<br>
found to stand at unequal intervals from each other in several bodies.<br>
The space between the insertions of both these muscles is indefinite,<br>
and may vary in degrees of width from the whole length of the clavicle<br>
to half an inch; or, as in some instances, leaving no interval whatever.<br>
The position of the omo-hyoid muscle will not be accounted a sure guide<br>
to the locality of the subclavian artery, since, in fact, it varies<br>
considerably as to its relationship with that vessel. The tense cords of<br>
the brachial plexus of nerves, F, Plate 8, which will be found, for the<br>
most part, ranging along the acromial border of the artery, are a much<br>
surer guide to the vessel.<br>
<br>
On comparing the subclavian artery, at B, Plate 8, with the common<br>
carotid artery, at A, Plate 7, I believe that the former will be found<br>
to exhibit, on the whole a greater constancy in respect to the<br>
following-mentioned condition--viz., a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">single</span> main arterial trunk arches<br>
over the first rib to pass beneath the middle of the clavicle, while the<br>
carotid artery opposite the thyroid piece of the larynx is by no means<br>
constantly single as a common carotid trunk. The place of division of<br>
the common carotid is not definite, and, therefore, the precise<br>
situation in the upper two-thirds of the neck, where it may present as a<br>
single main vessel, cannot be predicted with certainty in the<br>
undissected body. There is no other main artery of the body more liable<br>
to variation than that known as external carotid. It is subject to as<br>
many changes of character in respect to the place of its branching from<br>
the common carotid, and also in regard to the number of its own<br>
branches, as any of the lesser arteries of the system. It is but as an<br>
aggregate of the branches of that main arterial trunk which ranges from<br>
the carotid foramen of the temporal bone to the aorta; and, as a branch<br>
of a larger vessel, it is, therefore, liable to spring from various<br>
places of the principal trunk, just as we find to be the case with all<br>
the other minor branches of the larger arteries. Its name, external<br>
carotid, is as unfittingly applied to it, in comparison with the vessel<br>
from which it springs, as the name external subclavian would be if<br>
applied to the thyroid axis of the larger subclavian vessel. The<br>
nomenclature of surgical anatomy does not, however, court a<br>
philosophical inquiry into that propriety of speech which comparative<br>
science demands, nor is it supposed to be necessary in a practical point<br>
of view.<br>
<br>
It will, however, sound more euphoneously with reason, and at the same<br>
time, I believe, be found not altogether unrelated to the useful, if,<br>
when such conditions as the "anomalies of form" present themselves, we<br>
can advance an interpretation of the same, in addition to the dry record<br>
of them as isolated facts. Comparative anatomy, which alone can furnish<br>
these interpretations, will therefore prove to be no alien to the<br>
practical, while it may lend explanation to those bizarreries which<br>
impede the way of the anthropotomist. All the anomalies of form, both as<br>
regards the vascular, the muscular, and the osseous systems of the human<br>
body, are analyzed by comparison through the animal series. Numerous<br>
cases are on record of the subclavian artery being found complicated<br>
with supernumerary ribs jutting from the 5th, 6th, or 7th cervical<br>
vertebrae. [Footnote] To these I shall add another, in respect of the<br>
carotid arteries--viz., that I have found them complicated with an<br>
osseous shaft of bone, taking place of the stylo-hyoid ligament, a<br>
condition which obtains permanently in the ruminant and other classes of<br>
mammals.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: I have given an explanation of these facts in my work on<br>
Comparative Osteology and the Archetype Skeleton, to which, and also to<br>
Professor Owen's work, entitled Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton, I<br>
refer the reader.]<br>
