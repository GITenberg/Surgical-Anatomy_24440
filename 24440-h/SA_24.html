COMMENTARY ON PLATE 24.<br>
<br>
THE RELATIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL BLOODVESSELS<br>
TO THE VISCERA OF THE THORACICO-ABDOMINAL CAVITY.<br>
<br>
The median line of the body is occupied by the centres of the four great<br>
systems of organs which serve in the processes of circulation,<br>
respiration, innervation, and nutrition. These organs being fashioned in<br>
accordance with the law of symmetry, we find them arranged in close<br>
connexion with the vertebrate centre of the osseous fabric, which is<br>
itself symmetrical. In this symmetrical arrangement of the main organs<br>
of the trunk of the body, a mechanical principle is prominently<br>
apparent; for as the centre is the least moveable and most protected<br>
region of the form, so have these vitally important structures the full<br>
benefit of this situation. The aortal trunk, G, of the arterial system<br>
is disposed along the median line, as well for its own safety as for the<br>
fitting distribution of those branches which spring symmetrically from<br>
either side of it to supply the lateral regions of the body.<br>
<br>
The visceral system of bloodvessels is moulded upon the organs which<br>
they supply. As the thoracic viscera differ in form and functional<br>
character from those of the abdomen, so we find that the arterial<br>
branches which are supplied by the aorta to each set, differ likewise in<br>
some degree. In the accompanying figure, which represents the thoracic<br>
and abdominal visceral branches of the aorta taken in their entirety,<br>
this difference in their arrangement may be readily recognised. In the<br>
thorax, compared with the abdomen, we find that not only do the aortic<br>
branches differ in form according to the variety of those organs<br>
contained in either region, but that they differ numerically according<br>
to the number of organs situated in each. The main vessel itself,<br>
however, is common to both regions. It is the one thoracico-abdominal<br>
vessel, and this circumstance calls for the comparison, not only of the<br>
several parts of the great vessel itself, but of all the branches which<br>
spring from it, and of the various organs which lie in its vicinity in<br>
the thorax and abdomen, and hence we are invited to the study of these<br>
regions themselves connectedly.<br>
<br>
In the thorax, the aorta, G G*, is wholly concealed by the lungs in<br>
their states both of inspiration and expiration. The first part of the<br>
aortic arch, as it springs from the left ventricle of the heart, is the<br>
most superficial, being almost immediately sub-sternal, and on a level<br>
with the sternal junctions of the fourth ribs. By applying the ear at<br>
this locality, the play of the aortic valves may be distinctly heard.<br>
From this point the aorta, G, rises and arches from before, backwards,<br>
to the left side of the spine, G*. The arch of the vessel lies more<br>
deeply between the two lungs than does its ventricular origin. The<br>
descending thoracic aorta lies still more deeply situated at the left<br>
side of the dorsal spine. At this latter situation it is in immediate<br>
contact with the posterior thick part of the left lung; whilst on its<br>
right are placed, L, the thoracic duct; I, the oesophagus; K, the vena<br>
azygos, and the vertebral column. In Plate 26 may be seen the relation<br>
which the superior vena cava, H, bears to the aortic arch, A.<br>
<br>
In the span of the aortic arch will be found, H*, the left bronchus,<br>
together with the right branch of the pulmonary artery, and the right<br>
pulmonary veins. The pneumo-gastric and phrenic nerves descend on either<br>
side of the arch. The left pneumo-gastric nerve winds round beneath the<br>
arch at the point where the obliterated ductus arteriosus joins it. See<br>
Plates 12 &amp; 26.<br>
<br>
The pulmonary artery, B, Plates 1 &amp; 2, lies close upon the fore
part,<br>
and conceals the origin, of the systemic aorta. Whenever, therefore, the<br>
semilunar valves of either the pulmonary artery or the systemic aorta<br>
become diseased, it must be extremely difficult to distinguish by the<br>
sounds alone, during life, in which of the two the derangement exists.<br>
The origins of both vessels being at the fore part of the chest, it is<br>
in this situation, of course, that the state of their valves is to be<br>
examined. The descending part of the thoracic aorta, G*, being at the<br>
posterior part of the chest, and lying on the vertebral ends of the left<br>
thoracic ribs, will therefore require that we should examine its<br>
condition in the living body at the dorsal aspect of the thorax. As the<br>
arch of the aorta is directed from before backwards--that is, from the<br>
sternum to the spine, it follows that when an aneurism implicates this<br>
region of the vessel, the exact situation of the tumour must be<br>
determined by antero-posterior examination; and we should recollect,<br>
that though on the fore part of the chest the cartilages of the second<br>
ribs, where these join the sternum, mark the level of the aortic arch,<br>
on the back of the chest its level is to be taken from the vertebral<br>
ends of the third or fourth ribs. This difference is caused by the<br>
oblique descent of the ribs from the spine to the sternum. The first and<br>
second dorsal vertebrae, with which the first and second ribs<br>
articulate, are considerably above the level of the first and second<br>
pieces of the sternum.<br>
<br>
In a practical point of view, the pulmonary artery possesses but small<br>
interest for us; and in truth the trunk of the systemic aorta itself may<br>
be regarded in the same disheartening consideration, forasmuch as when<br>
serious disease attacks either vessel, the "tree of life" may be said to<br>
be lopped at its root.<br>
<br>
When an aneurism arises from the aortic arch it implicates those<br>
important organs which are gathered together in contact with itself. The<br>
aneurismal tumour may press upon and obstruct the bronchi, H H*; the<br>
thoracic duct, L; the oesophagus, I; the superior vena cava, H, Plate<br>
26, or wholly obliterate either of the vagi nerves. The aneurism of the<br>
arch of the aorta may cause suffocation in two ways--viz., either by<br>
pressing directly on the tracheal tube, or by compressing and irritating<br>
the vagus nerve, whose recurrent branch will convey the stimulus to the<br>
laryngeal muscles, and cause spasmodic closure of the glottis. This<br>
anatomical fact also fully accounts for the constant cough which attends<br>
some forms of aortic aneurism. The pulmonary arteries and veins are also<br>
liable to obstruction from the tumour. This will occur the more<br>
certainly if the aneurism spring from the right or the inferior side of<br>
the arch, and if the tumour should not break at an early period, slow<br>
absorption, caused by pressure of the tumour, may destroy even the<br>
vertebral column, and endanger the spinal nervous centre. If the tumour<br>
spring from the left side or the fore part of the arch, it may in time<br>
force a passage through the anterior wall of the thorax.<br>
<br>
The principal branches of the thoracic aorta spring from the upper part<br>
of its arch. The innominate artery, 2, is the first to arise from it;<br>
the left common carotid, 6, and the left subclavian artery, 5, spring in<br>
succession. These vessels being destined for the head and upper limbs,<br>
we find that the remaining branches of the thoracic aorta are<br>
comparatively diminutive, and of little surgical interest. The<br>
intercostal arteries occasionally, when wounded, call for the aid of the<br>
surgeon; these arteries, like all other branches of the aorta, are<br>
largest at their origin. Where these vessels spring from G, the<br>
descending thoracic aorta, they present considerable caliber; but at<br>
this inaccessible situation, they seldom or never call for surgical<br>
interference. As the intercostal arteries pass outwards, traversing the<br>
intercostal spaces with their accompanying nerves, they diminish in<br>
size. Each vessel divides at a distance of about two inches, more or<br>
less, from the spine; and the upper larger branch lies under cover of<br>
the inferior border of the adjacent rib. When it is required to perform<br>
the operation of paracentesis thoracis, this distribution of the vessel<br>
should be borne in mind; and also, that the farther from the spine this<br>
operation is performed, the less in size will the vessels be found. The<br>
intercostal artery is sometimes wounded by the fractured end of the rib,<br>
in which case, if the pleura be lacerated, an effusion of blood takes<br>
place within the thorax, compresses the lung, and obstructs respiration.<br>
<br>
The thoracic aorta descends along the left side of the spine, as far as<br>
the last dorsal vertebra, at which situation the pillars of the<br>
diaphragm overarch the vessel. From this place the aorta passes<br>
obliquely in front of the five lumbar vertebrae, and on arriving<br>
opposite the fourth, it divides into the two common iliac branches. The<br>
aorta, for an extent included between these latter boundaries, is named<br>
the abdominal aorta, and from its fore part arise those branches, which<br>
supply the viscera of the abdomen.<br>
<br>
The branches which spring from the abdominal aorta to supply the viscera<br>
of this region, are considerable, both as to their number and size. They<br>
are, however, of comparatively little interest in practice. To the<br>
anatomist they present many peculiarities of distribution and form<br>
worthy of notice, as, for example, their frequent anastomosis, their<br>
looping arrangement, and their large size and number compared with the<br>
actual bulk of the organs which they supply. As to this latter<br>
peculiarity, we interpret it according to the fact that here the vessels<br>
serve other purposes in the economy besides that of the support and<br>
repair of structure. The vessels are large in proportion to the great<br>
quantity of fluid matter secreted from the whole extent of the inner<br>
surface of this glandular apparatus--the gastro-intestinal canal, the<br>
liver, pancreas, and kidneys.<br>
<br>
As anatomists, we are enabled, from a knowledge of the relative position<br>
of the various organs and bloodvessels of both the thorax and abdomen,<br>
to account for certain pathological phenomena which, as practitioners,<br>
we possess as yet but little skill to remedy. Thus it would appear most<br>
probable that many cases of anasarca of the lower limbs, and of dropsy<br>
of the belly, are frequently caused by diseased growths of the liver, P,<br>
obstructing the inferior vena cava, R, and vena portae, rather than by<br>
what we are taught to be the "want of balance between secreting and<br>
absorbing surfaces." The like occurrence may obstruct the gall-ducts,<br>
and occasion jaundice. Over-distention of any of those organs situated<br>
beneath the right hypochondrium, will obstruct neighbouring organs and<br>
vessels. Mechanical obstruction is doubtless so frequent a source of<br>
derangement, that we need not on many occasions essay a deeper search<br>
for explaining the mystery of disease.<br>
<br>
In the right hypochondriac region there exists a greater variety of<br>
organs than in the left; and disease is also more frequent on the right<br>
side. Affections of the liver will consequently implicate a greater<br>
number of organs than affections of the spleen on the left side, for the<br>
spleen is comparatively isolated from the more important blood vessels<br>
and other organs.<br>
<br>
The external surface of the liver, P, lies in contact with the<br>
diaphragm, N, the costal cartilages, M, and the upper and lateral parts<br>
of the abdominal parietes; and when the liver becomes the seat of<br>
abscess, this, according to its situation, will point and burst either<br>
into the thorax above, or through the side between or beneath the false<br>
ribs, M. The hepatic abscess has been known to discharge itself through<br>
the stomach, the duodenum, T, and the transverse colon, facts which are<br>
readily explained on seeing the close relationship which these parts<br>
hold to the under surface of the liver. When the liver is inflamed, we<br>
account for the gastric irritation, either from the inflammation having<br>
extended to the neighbouring stomach, or by this latter organ being<br>
affected by "reflex action." The hepatic cough is caused by the like<br>
phenomena disturbing the diaphragm, N, with which the liver, P, lies in<br>
close contact.<br>
<br>
When large biliary concretions form in S, the gallbladder, or in the<br>
hepatic duct, Nature, failing in her efforts to discharge them through<br>
the common bile-duct, into the duodenum, T, sets up inflammation and<br>
ulcerative absorption, by aid of which processes they make a passage for<br>
themselves through some adjacent part of the intestine, either the<br>
duodenum or the transverse colon. In these processes the gall-bladder,<br>
which contains the calculus, becomes soldered by effused lymph to the<br>
neighbouring part of the intestinal tube, into which the stone is to be<br>
discharged, and thus its escape into the peritoneal sac is prevented.<br>
When the hepatic abscess points externally towards M, the like process<br>
isolates the matter from the cavities of the chest and abdomen.<br>
<br>
In wounds of any part of the intestine, whether of X, the caecum, W, the<br>
sigmoid flexure of the colon, or Z, the small bowel, if sufficient time<br>
be allowed for Nature to establish the adhesive inflammation, she does<br>
so, and thus fortifies the peritoneal sac against an escape of the<br>
intestinal matter into it by soldering the orifice of the wounded<br>
intestine to the external opening. In this mode is formed the artificial<br>
anus. The surgeon on principle aids Nature in attaining this result.<br>
