COMMENTARY ON PLATE 25.<br>
<br>
THE RELATION OF THE PRINCIPAL BLOODVESSELS OF THE THORAX AND<br>
ABDOMEN TO THE OSSEOUS SKELETON, ETC.<br>
<br>
The arterial system of vessels assumes, in all cases, somewhat of the<br>
character of the forms upon which they are distributed, or of the organs<br>
which they supply. This mode of distribution becomes the more apparent,<br>
according as we rise from particulars to take a view of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">the whole</span>. With<br>
the same ease that any piece of the osseous fabric, taken separately,<br>
may be known, so may any one artery, taken apart from the rest, be<br>
distinguished as to the place which it occupied, and the organs which it<br>
supplied in the economy. The vascular skeleton, whether taken as a whole<br>
or in parts, exhibits characteristics as apparent as are those of the<br>
osseous skeleton itself. The main bloodvessel, A B C, of the trunk of<br>
the body, possesses character, <span style="font-style: italic;">sui
generis</span>, just as the vertebral column<br>
itself manifests. The main arteries of the head or limbs are as readily<br>
distinguishable, the one from the other, as are the osseous fabrics of<br>
the head and limbs. The visceral arteries are likewise moulded upon the<br>
forms which they supply. But evidently the arterial system of vessels<br>
conforms most strictly with the general design of the osseous skeleton.<br>
<br>
In Plate 25, viewed as a whole, we find that as the vertebral column<br>
stands central to the osseous skeleton, so does the aorta, A B C, take<br>
the centre of the arterial skeleton. As the ribs jut symmetrically from<br>
either side of the vertebral column, so do the intercostal arteries<br>
follow them from their own points of origin in the aorta. The one side<br>
of the osseous system is not more like the other than is the system of<br>
vessels on one side like that of the other. And in addition to this fact<br>
of a similarity of sides in the vascular as in the osseous skeleton, I<br>
also remark that both extremities of the aorta divide into branches<br>
which are similar to one another above and below, thereby conforming<br>
exactly with the upper and lower limbs, which manifest unmistakable<br>
points of analogy.<br>
<br>
The branches which spring from the aortic arch above are destined to<br>
supply the head and upper limbs. They are, H, the innominate artery, and<br>
I K, the left common carotid and subclavian arteries. The branches which<br>
spring from the other extremity of the aorta are disposed for the<br>
support of the pelvis and lower limbs; they are the right and left<br>
common iliac arteries, L M. These vessels exhibit, at both ends of the<br>
main aortic trunk, a remarkable analogy; and as the knowledge of this<br>
fact may serve to lighten the dry and weary detail of descriptive<br>
anatomy, at the same time that it points directly to views of practical<br>
import, I may be allowed briefly to remark upon it as follows:--<br>
<br>
The vessels which spring from both ends of the aorta, as seen in Plate<br>
25, are represented in what is called their normal character--that is,<br>
while three vessels, H I K, spring separately from the aortic arch<br>
above, only two vessels, L and M, arise from the aorta below. Let the<br>
anatomist now recall to mind the "peculiarities" which at times appear<br>
amongst the vessels, H I K, above, and he will find that some of them<br>
absolutely correspond to the normal arrangement of the vessels, L M,<br>
below. And if he will consider the "peculiarities" which occur to the<br>
normal order of the vessels, L M, below, he will find that some of these<br>
correspond exactly to the normal order of the vessels above. Thus, when<br>
I K of the left side join into a common trunk, this resembles the<br>
innominate artery, H, of the right side, and then both these vessels<br>
perfectly correspond with the two common iliac arteries below. When, on<br>
the other hand, L and M, the common iliac arteries, divide,<br>
immediately after leaving the aortic trunk, into two pairs of branches,<br>
they correspond to the abnormal condition of the vessels, H I K, above;<br>
where H, immediately after leaving the aortic arch, divides into two<br>
branches, like I K. With this generalization upon the normal and<br>
abnormal facts of arrangement, exhibited among the vessels arising from<br>
both ends of the aorta, I furnish to the reader the idea that the<br>
vessels, H I K, above may present of the same figure as the vessels, L<br>
M, below, and these latter may assume the character of H I K, above.<br>
Whenever, therefore, either set of vessels becomes the subject of<br>
operation, such as having a ligature applied to them, we must be<br>
prepared to meet the "varieties."<br>
<br>
The veins assume an arrangement similar to that of the arteries, and the<br>
above remarks will therefore equally apply to the veins. In the same way<br>
as the arteries, H I K, may present in the condition of two common or<br>
brachio-cephalic trunks, and thereby simulate the condition of the<br>
common iliac arteries, so we find that the normal forms of the veins<br>
above and below actually and permanently exhibit this very type. The<br>
brachio-cephalic veins, D B, Plate 26, exactly correspond to each<br>
other, and to the common iliac veins, S T; and as these latter<br>
correspond precisely with the common iliac arteries, so may we infer<br>
that the original or typical condition of the vessels I K, Plate 25, is<br>
a brachia-cephalic or common-trunk union corresponding with its<br>
brachio-cephalic vein. When the vessels, I K, therefore present of the<br>
brachio-cephalic form as the vessel H, we have a perfect correspondence<br>
between the two extremes of the aorta, both as regards the arteries<br>
arising from it, and the veins which accompany these arteries; and this<br>
condition of the vascular skeleton I regard as the typical uniformity.<br>
The separate condition of the vessels I K, notwithstanding the frequency<br>
of the occurrence of such, may be considered as a special variation from<br>
the original type.<br>
<br>
The length of the aorta is variable in two or more bodies; and so,<br>
likewise, is the length of the trunk of each of those great branches<br>
which springs from its arch above, and of those into which it divides<br>
below, The modes in which these variations as to length occur, are<br>
numerous. The top of the arch of the aorta is described as being in<br>
general on a level with the cartilages of the second ribs, from which<br>
point it descends on the left side of the spinal column; and after<br>
having wound gradually forwards to the forepart of the lumbar spine at<br>
C, divides opposite to the fourth lumbar vertebra into the right and<br>
left common iliac arteries. The length of that portion of the aorta<br>
which is called thoracic, is determined by the position of the pillars<br>
of the diaphragm F, which span the vessel; and from this point to where<br>
the aorta divides into the two common iliac arteries, the main vessel is<br>
named abdominal. The aorta, from its arch to its point of division on<br>
the lumbar vertebrae, gradually diminishes in caliber, according to the<br>
number and succession of the branches derived from it.<br>
<br>
The varieties as to length exhibited by the aorta itself, and by the<br>
principal branches which spring from it, occur under the following<br>
mentioned conditions:--When the arch of the aorta rises above or sinks<br>
below its ordinary position or level,--namely, the cartilages of the<br>
second ribs, as seen in Plate 25,--it varies not only its own length,<br>
but also that of the vessels H I K; for if the arch of the aorta rises<br>
above this level, the vessels H I K become shortened; and as the arch<br>
sinks below this level, these vessels become lengthened. Even when the<br>
aortic arch holds its proper level in the thorax, still the vessels H I<br>
K may vary as to length, according to the height to which they rise in<br>
the neck previously to their division. When the aorta sinks below its<br>
proper level at the same time that the vessels H I K rise considerably<br>
above that point at which they usually arch or divide in the neck, then<br>
of course their length becomes greatly increased. When, on the other<br>
hand, the aortic arch rises above its usual level, whilst the vessels H<br>
I K arch and divide at a low position in the neck, then their length<br>
becomes very much diminished. The length of the artery H may be<br>
increased even though the arch of the aorta holds its proper level, and<br>
though the vessels H I K occupy their usual position in the neck; for it<br>
is true that the vessel H may spring from a point of the aortic arch A<br>
nearer to the origin of this from the ventricle of the heart, whilst the<br>
vessel I may be shortened, owing to the fact of its arising from some<br>
part of H, the innominate vessel. All these circumstances are so<br>
obvious, that they need no comment, were it not for the necessity of<br>
impressing the surgeon with the fact that uncertainty as to a successful<br>
result must always attach to his operation of including in a ligature<br>
either of the vessels H I K, so as to affect an aneurismal tumour.<br>
<br>
Now whilst the length of the aorta and that of the principal branches<br>
springing from its arch may be varied according to the above-mentioned<br>
conditions, so may the length of the aorta itself, and of the two common<br>
iliac vessels, vary according to the place whereat the aorta, C,<br>
bifurcates. Or, even when this point of division is opposite the usual<br>
vertebra,--viz., the fourth lumbar,--still the common iliac vessels may<br>
be short or long, according to the place where they divide into external<br>
and internal iliac branches. The aorta may bifurcate almost as high up<br>
as where the pillars of the diaphragm overarch it, or as low down as the<br>
fifth lumbar vertebra. The occasional existence of a sixth lumbar<br>
vertebra also causes a variety in the length, not only of the aorta, but<br>
of the two common iliac vessels and their branches.[Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Whatever may be the number of variations to which the<br>
branches arising from both extremes of the aorta are liable, all<br>
anatomists admit that the arrangement of these vessels, as exhibited in<br>
Plate 25, is by far the most frequent. The surgical anatomist,<br>
therefore, when planning his operation, takes this arrangement as the<br>
standard type. Haller asserts this order of the vessels to be so<br>
constant, that in four hundred bodies which he examined, he found only<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">one variety</span>--namely, that in
which the left vertebral artery arose from<br>
the aorta. Of other varieties described by authors, he observes--"Rara<br>
vero haec omnia esse si dixero cum quadringenta nunc cadavera humana<br>
dissecuerim, fidem forte inveniam." (Iconum Anatom.) This variety is<br>
also stated by J. F. Meckel (Handbuch der Mensch Anat.), Soemmerring (De<br>
Corp. Hum Fabrica), Boyer (Tr. d'Anat.), and Mr. Harrison (Surg. Anal.<br>
of Art.), to be the most frequent. Tiedemann figures this variety<br>
amongst others (Tabulae Arteriarum). Mr. Quain regards as the most<br>
frequent change which occurs in the number of the branches of the aortic<br>
arch, "that in which the left carotid is derived from the innominate."<br>
(Anatomy of the Arteries, &amp;c.) A case is recorded by Petsche
(quoted in<br>
Haller), in which he states the bifurcation of the aorta to have taken<br>
place at the origin of the renal arteries: (query) are we to suppose<br>
that the renal arteries occupied their usual position? Cruveilhier<br>
records a case (Anal. Descript.) in which the right common iliac was<br>
wanting, in consequence of having divided at the aorta into the internal<br>
and external iliac branches. Whether the knowledge of these and numerous<br>
other varieties of the arterial system be of much practical import to<br>
the surgeon, he will determine for himself. To the scientific anatomist,<br>
it must appear that the main object in regard to them is to submit them<br>
to a strict analogical reasoning, so as to demonstrate the operation of<br>
that law which has produced them. To this end I have pointed to that<br>
analogy which exists between the vessels arising from both extremities<br>
of the aorta. "Itaque convertenda plane est opera ad inquirendas et<br>
notandas rerum similitudines et analoga tam integralibus quam partibus;<br>
illae enim sunt, quae naturam uniunt, et constituere scientias<br>
incipiunt." "Natura enim non nisi parendo vincitur; et quod in<br>
contemplatione instar causae est; id in operatione instar regulae est."<br>
(Novum Organum Scientiarum, Aph. xxvii-iii, lib. i.)]<br>
<br>
The difference between the perpendicular range of the anterior and<br>
posterior walls of the thoracic cavity may be estimated on a reference<br>
to Plate 25, in which the xyphoid cartilage, E, joined to the seventh<br>
pair of ribs, bounds its anterior wall below, while F, the pillars of<br>
the diaphragm, bound its posterior wall. The thoracic cavity is<br>
therefore considerably deeper in its posterior than in its anterior<br>
wall; and this occasions a difference of an opposite kind in the<br>
anterior and posterior walls of the abdomen; for while the abdomen<br>
ranges perpendicularly from E to W, its posterior range measures only<br>
from F to the ventra of the iliac bones, R. The arching form of the<br>
diaphragm, and the lower level which the pubic symphysis occupies<br>
compared with that of the cristae of the iliac bones, occasion this<br>
difference in the measure of both the thorax and abdomen.<br>
<br>
The usual position of the kidneys, G G*, is on either side of the lumbar<br>
spine, between the last ribs and the cristae of the iliac bones. The<br>
kidneys lie on the fore part of the quadratus lumborum and psoae<br>
muscles. They are sometimes found to have descended as low as the iliac<br>
fossae, R, in consequence of pressure, occasioned by an enlarged liver<br>
on the right, or by an enlarged spleen on the left. The length of the<br>
abdominal part of the aorta may be estimated as being a third of the<br>
entire vessel, measured from the top of its arch to its point of<br>
bifurcation. So many and such large vessels arise from the abdominal<br>
part of the aorta, and these are set so closely to each other, that it<br>
must in all cases be very difficult to choose a proper locality whereat<br>
to apply a ligature on this region of the vessel. If other circumstances<br>
could fairly justify such an operation, the anatomist believes that the<br>
circulation might be maintained through the anastomosis of the internal<br>
mammary and intercostal arteries with the epigastric; the branches of<br>
the superior mesenteric with those of the inferior; and the branches of<br>
this latter with the perineal branches of the pubic. The lumbar, the<br>
gluteal, and the circumflex ilii arteries, also communicate around the<br>
hip-bone. The same vessels would serve to carryon the circulation if<br>
either L, the common iliac, V, the external iliac, or the internal iliac<br>
vessel, were the subject of the operation by ligature.<br>
