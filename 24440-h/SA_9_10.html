<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE STERNO-CLAVICULAR OR TRACHEAL<br>
REGION, AND THE RELATIVE POSITION OF ITS MAIN BLOODVESSELS,<br>
NERVES, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The law of symmetry governs the development of all structures which<br>
compose the human body; and all organized beings throughout the animal<br>
kingdom are produced in obedience to this law. The general median line<br>
of the human body is characterized as the point of fusion of the two<br>
sides; and all structures or organs which range this common centre are<br>
either symmetrically azygos, or symmetrically duplex. The azygos organ<br>
presents as a symmetrical unity, and the duplex organ as a symmetrical<br>
duality. The surgical anatomist takes a studious observation of this law<br>
of symmetry; and knowing it to be one of general and almost<br>
unexceptional occurrence, he practises according to its manifestation.<br>
<br>
The vascular as well as the osseous skeleton displays the law of<br>
symmetry; but while the osseous system offers no exception to this law,<br>
the vascular system offers one which, in a surgical point of view, is of<br>
considerable importance--namely, that behind the right sterno-clavicular<br>
articulation, C, Plate 9, is found the artery, A, named innominate, this<br>
being the common trunk of the right common carotid and subclavian<br>
vessels; while on the left side, behind the left sterno-clavicular<br>
junction, Q, Plate 10, the two vessels (subclavian, B, and carotid, A,)<br>
spring separately from the aortic arch. This fact of asymmetrical<br>
arrangement in the arterial trunks at the fore part of the root of the<br>
neck is not, however, of invariable occurrence; on the contrary,<br>
numerous instances are observed where the arteries in question, on the<br>
right side as well as the left, arise separately from the aorta; and<br>
thus Nature reverts to the original condition of perfect symmetry as<br>
governing the development of even the vascular skeleton. And not<br>
unfrequently, as if to invite us to the inquiry whether a separate<br>
origin of the four vessels (subclavian and carotid) from the aorta, or a<br>
double innominate condition of the vessels, were the original form with<br>
Nature, we find her also presenting this latter arrangement of them. An<br>
innominate or common aortic origin may happen for the carotid and<br>
subclavian arteries of the left side, as well as the right. Hence,<br>
therefore, while experience may arm the judgment with a general rule,<br>
such generality should not render us unmindful of the possible<br>
exception.<br>
<br>
When, as in Plate 9, A, the innominate artery rises to a level with C,<br>
the right sterno-clavicular junction, and when at this place it<br>
bifurcates, having on its left side, D, the trachea, and on its right<br>
side, B, the root of the internal jugular vein, together with <span
 style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, the<br>
vagus nerve, the arterial vessel is said to be of normal character, and<br>
holding a normal position relative to adjacent organs. When, as in Plate<br>
10, A, the common carotid, and B, the subclavian artery, rise separately<br>
from the aortic arch to a level with Q, the left sterno-clavicular<br>
articulation, the vessels having M, the trachea, to their inner side,<br>
and&nbsp; C D, the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian
veins, to<br>
their outer side, with <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, the
left vagus nerve, between them, then the<br>
arterial vessels are accounted as being of normal character, and as<br>
holding a normal relative position. Every exception to this condition of<br>
A, Plate 9, or to that of A B, Plate 10, is said to be abnormal or<br>
peculiar, and merely because the disposition of the vessels, as seen in<br>
Plates 9 and 10, is taken to be general or of more frequent occurrence.<br>
<br>
Now, though it is not my present purpose to burden this subject of<br>
regional anatomy with any lengthy inquiry into the comparative meaning<br>
of the facts, why a common innominate trunk should occur on the right of<br>
the median line, while separate arterial trunks for the carotid and<br>
subclavian arteries should spring from the aorta on the left of this<br>
mid-line, thus making a remarkable exception to the rule of symmetry<br>
which characterizes all the arterial vessels elsewhere, still I cannot<br>
but regard this exceptional fact of asymmetry as in itself expressing a<br>
question by no means foreign to the interests of the practical.<br>
<br>
In the abstract or general survey of all those peculiarities of length<br>
to which the innominate artery, A, Plate 9, is subject, I here lay it<br>
down as a proposition, that they occur as graduated phases of the<br>
bicleavage of this innominate trunk from the level of A, to the aortic<br>
arch, in which latter phasis the aorta gives a separate origin to the<br>
carotid and subclavian vessels of the right side as well as the left. On<br>
the other hand, I observe that the peculiarities to the normal separate<br>
condition of A and B, the carotid and subclavian arteries of Plate 10,<br>
display, in the relationary aggregate, a phasial gradation of A and B<br>
joining into a common trunk union, in which state we then find the aorta<br>
giving origin to a right and left innominate artery. Between these two<br>
forms of development--viz., that where the four vessels spring<br>
separately from the aortic arch, and that where two innominate or<br>
brachio-cephalic arteries arise from the same--may be read all the sum<br>
of variation to which these vessels are liable. It is true that there<br>
are some states of these vessels which cannot be said to be naturally<br>
embraced in the above generalization; but though I doubt not that these<br>
might be encompassed in a higher generalization; still, for all<br>
practical ends, the lesser general rule is all-sufficient.<br>
<br>
In many instances, the innominate artery, A, Plate 9, is of such<br>
extraordinary length, that it rises considerably (for an inch, or even<br>
more) above the level of C, the sternal end of the clavicle. In other<br>
cases, the innominate artery bifurcates soon after it leaves the first<br>
part of the aortic arch; and between these extremes as to length, the<br>
vessel varies infinitesimally.<br>
<br>
The innominate artery lies closer behind the right sterno-clavicular<br>
junction than the left carotid or subclavian arteries lie in relation to<br>
the left sterno-clavicular articulation; and this difference of depth<br>
between the vessel of the right side and those of the left is mainly<br>
owing to the form and direction of the aortic arch from which they take<br>
origin. The aortic arch ranges, not alone transversely, but also from<br>
before backward, and to the left side of the dorsal spine; and<br>
consequently, as the innominate artery, A, Plate 9, springs from the<br>
first or fore part of the aorta, while the left carotid and subclavian<br>
arteries arise from the second and deeper part of its arch, the vessels<br>
of both sides rising into the neck perpendicularly from the root in the<br>
thorax, will still, in the cervical region, manifest a considerable<br>
difference as to antero-posterior depth. The depth of the left<br>
subclavian artery, B, Plate 10, from cervical surface, is even greater<br>
than that of the left common carotid, A, Plate 10, and this latter, at<br>
its root in the aortic arch, is deeper than the innominate artery. Both<br>
common carotids, A A, Plates 9 and 10, hold nearly the same<br>
antero-posterior depth on either side of the trachea, M, Plate 10, and<br>
D, Plate 9. Although the relative depth of the arterial vessels on both<br>
sides of the trachea is different, still they are covered by an equal<br>
number of identical structures, taking the same order of superposition.<br>
<br>
On either side of the episternal cervical pit, which, even in the<br>
undissected body of male or female, infant or adult, is always a<br>
well-marked surgical feature, may be readily recognised the converging<br>
sternal attachments of the sterno-mastoid muscles, L G, Plate 10; and<br>
midway between these symmetrical muscular prominences in the neck, but<br>
holding a deeper level than them, is situated that part of the trachea<br>
which is generally the subject of the operation of tracheotomy. The<br>
relative anatomy of the trachea, M, Plate 10, D, Plate 9, at this<br>
situation requires therefore to be carefully considered. The trachea is<br>
said to incline rather to the right side of the median line; but perhaps<br>
this observation would be more true to nature if it were accompanied by<br>
the remark, that this seeming inclination to the right side is owing to<br>
the fact, that the innominate artery, A, Plate 9, lies obliquely over<br>
its fore part, near the sternum. However this may be, it certainly will<br>
be the safer step in the operation to regard the median position of the<br>
trachea as fixed, than to encroach upon the locality of the carotid<br>
vessels; and to make the incision longitudinally and exactly through the<br>
median line, while the neck is extended backwards, and the chin made to<br>
correspond with the line of incision. And when the operator takes into<br>
consideration the situation of the vessel A, Plate 9, and A, Plate 10,<br>
at this region of the neck, he will at once own to the necessity of<br>
opening the trachea, D, Plate 9, M, Plate 10, at a situation nearer the<br>
larynx than the point marked in the figures. The course taken by the<br>
common carotid arteries is, in respect to the trachea, divergent from<br>
below upwards; and as these vessels will consequently be found to stand<br>
wider apart at the level of K, I, Plate 10, than they do at the level of<br>
M, Plate 10, so the farther upwards from the sternum we choose the point<br>
at which to open the trachea, the less likely are we to endanger the<br>
great arterial vessels.<br>
<br>
In addition to the fact, that the carotid arteries at an inch above the<br>
sternum lie nearer the median line than they do higher up in the neck,<br>
it should always be remembered, that the trachea itself is situated much<br>
deeper at the point M, Plate 10, D, Plate 9, than it is opposite the<br>
points F and K of the same figures. The laryngo-tracheal line is, in the<br>
lateral view of the neck, downwards and backwards, and therefore it will<br>
be found always at a considerable depth from cervical surface, as it<br>
passes behind the first bone of the sternum, midway between both<br>
sterno-mastoid muscles.<br>
<br>
In the operation of tracheotomy, the cutting instrument divides the<br>
following named structures as they lie beneath the common integument: If<br>
the incision be made directly upon the median line, the muscles F,<br>
sterno-hyoid, and E, sterno-thyroid, Plate 9, are not necessarily<br>
divided, as these structures and their fellows hold a somewhat lateral<br>
position opposite to each other. Beneath these muscles and above them,<br>
thus encasing them, the cervical fascia, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">f f,</span> Plate 10, is required to<br>
be divided, in order to expose the trachea. Beneath <span
 style="font-style: italic;">f f </span>the cervical<br>
fascia, will next be felt the rounded bilobed mass of the thyroid body,<br>
lying on the forepart of the trachea; above the thyroid body, the<br>
cricoid and some tracheal cartilaginous rings will be felt; and since<br>
the thyroid body varies much as to bulk in several individuals of the<br>
same and different sexes, as also from a consideration that its<br>
substance is traversed by large arterial and venous vessels, it will be<br>
therefore preferable to open the trachea above it, than through it or<br>
below it.<br>
<br>
On the forepart of the tracheal median line, either superficial to, or<br>
deeper than, the cervical fascia, the tracheotomist occasionally meets<br>
with a chain of lymphatic glands or a plexus of veins, which latter,<br>
when divided, will trammel the operation by the copious haemorrhage<br>
which all veins at this region of the neck are prone to supply, owing to<br>
their direct communication with the main venous trunks of the heart; and<br>
not unfrequently the inferior thyroid artery overlies the trachea at the<br>
point D, Plate 9, when this thyroid vessel arises directly from the arch<br>
of the aorta, between the roots of the innominate and left common<br>
carotid, or when it springs from the innominate itself. The inferior<br>
thyroid vein, sometimes single and sometimes double, overlies the<br>
trachea at the point D, Plate 9, when this vein opens into the left<br>
innominate venous trunk, as this latter crosses over the root of the<br>
main arteries springing from the aorta.<br>
<br>
Laryngotomy is, anatomically considered, a far less dangerous operation<br>
than tracheotomy, for the above-named reasons; and the former should<br>
always be preferred when particular circumstances do not render the<br>
latter operation absolutely necessary. In addition to the fact, that the<br>
carotid arteries lie farther apart from each other and from the median<br>
place--viz., the crico-thyroid interval, which is the seat of<br>
laryngotomy--than they do lower down on either side of the trachea, it<br>
should also be noticed that the tracheal tube being more moveable than<br>
the larynx, is hence more liable to swerve from the cutting instrument,<br>
and implicate the vessels. Tracheotomy on the infant is a far more<br>
anxious proceeding than the same operation performed on the adult;<br>
because the trachea in the infant's body lies more closely within the<br>
embrace of the carotid arteries, is less in diameter, shorter, and more<br>
mobile than in the adult body.<br>
<br>
The episternal or interclavicular region is a locality traversed by so<br>
many vitally important structures gathered together in a very limited<br>
space, that all operations which concern this region require more steady<br>
caution and anatomical knowledge than most surgeons are bold enough to<br>
test their possession of. The reader will (on comparing Plates 9 and 10)<br>
be enabled to take account of those structures which it is necessary to<br>
divide in the operation required for ligaturing the innominate artery,<br>
A, Plate 9, or either of those main arterial vessels (the right common<br>
carotid and subclavian) which spring from it; and he will also observe<br>
that, although the same number and kind of structures overlie the<br>
carotid and subclavian vessels, A B, of the left side, Plate 10, still,<br>
that these vessels themselves, in consequence of their separate<br>
condition, will materially influence the like operation in respect to<br>
them. An aneurism occurring in the first part of the course of the right<br>
subclavian artery, at the locality <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>,
Plate 9, will lie so close to the<br>
origin of the right common carotid as to require a ligature to be passed<br>
around the innominate common trunk, thus cutting off the flow of blood<br>
from both vessels; whereas an aneurism implicating either the left<br>
common carotid at the point A, or the left subclavian artery at the<br>
point B, does not, of course, require that both vessels should be<br>
included in the same ligature. There seems to be, therefore, a greater<br>
probability of effectually treating an aneurism of the left<br>
brachio-cephalic vessels by ligature than attaches to those of the right<br>
side; for if space between collateral branches, and also a lesser<br>
caliber of arterial trunk, be advantages, allowing the ligature to hold<br>
more firmly, then the vessels of the left side of the root of the neck<br>
manifest these advantages more frequently than those of the right, which<br>
spring from a common trunk. Whenever, therefore, the "peculiarity" of a<br>
separate aortic origin of the right carotid and subclavian arteries<br>
occurs, it is to be regarded more as a happy advantage than otherwise.<br>
